- In **interval Arithmetic** is doing *mathematical computations* with `ranges` instead of **`exact numbers`**
- Where instead of stating that the answer is `5` you would state the answer is between `3.9` and `5.1`
-  It's especially useful in fields like science and engineering where being very close to the right answer is often good enough.


```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <suninterval.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Define intervals
    interval<double> X("[2,3]");
    interval<double> Y("[4,5]");

    // Perform addition
    interval<double> Z = X + Y;

    // Check if the result is as expected
    if (Z == interval<double>("[6,8]")) {
        cout << "Check." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Coding in Science

Every good programming language according to SICP must be able to handle every mathematical computation out there or at least a good programming language that  is !

- With that being said the most popular programming language such as python  should be able to do the trick hence the book mathematical journeys with python (it might be called that?\)

Upon Further research Python is very versitile and its rich ecosystem of libraries will help with   physics .  Python`offers numerous libraries (like Matplotlib, NumPy, and SciPy)`



# Example! 

### Problem Statement

```C++
A runner starts from rest at the top of a hill with an inclination angle θ and runs down the hill with a constant acceleration due to gravity. The runner's mass is (m) kg, and the driving force (the force that propels the runner forward) is (F_d = 400 , N). We need to calculate the time (T) it takes for the runner to cover a distance (d) meters down the hill.
```

```Python 
import math

def calculate_time(mass, angle_degrees, distance):
    # Convert angle to radians
    angle_radians = math.radians(angle_degrees)
    
    # Calculate gravitational acceleration component perpendicular to the hill
    g_perpendicular = math.sin(angle_radians) * 9.81
    
    # Calculate the time taken to cover the distance
    T = (-mass * g_perpendicular / 400) + math.sqrt((mass * g_perpendicular / 400)**2 + 2 * distance / 400)
    
    return T

# Example usage
mass_kg = 80  # Mass of the runner in kg
angle_degrees = 30  # Angle of the hill in degrees
distance_m = 100  # Distance covered in meters

time_seconds = calculate_time(mass_kg, angle_degrees, distance_m)
print(f"The runner will take approximately {time_seconds:.2f} seconds to cover {distance_m} meters.")
```
