“I see you have experience with Python, Bash, and C++. How do you typically use them in cybersecurity projects?”

Bash I use it to automate simple tasks within my Linux system such as starting multiple docker containers or downloading images from docker or downloading any mulitple services and libraries I generally need for a project. Same goes for python I use it to automate more advance tasks such as starting multiple containers or creating dockerfiles that are similar to others with just slight differences. I have also in my IDS_AI project I have made a nmap/wireshark pcap analyzer where it takes traffic from a network and puts it into a pcap file which the same program can read and open pcap files to analyze issues or whats happening on the network  I did with the Scapy library in python which comes with alot of essential tools when using python for cybersecurity. C++ I've used to understand how lowlevel code works underhood Ive made a C++ password generator using the OpenSSL libary which comes with its own encryption library and algorthims for making strong and secure passwords.
