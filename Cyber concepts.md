### 🔒 **Confidentiality**

**Your Explanation:** "Confidentiality is what you want people to see, like our passwords and personal data or if we have a private account, our account from unauthorized users."​

**Evaluation:** You're on the right track by associating confidentiality with protecting sensitive information. However, the phrase "what you want people to see" might be misleading. Confidentiality is about ensuring that sensitive information is **not** accessible to unauthorized individuals.​

**Improved Explanation:** "Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information, such as passwords and personal data, is accessible only to authorized individuals, preventing unauthorized access."

### 🧬 **Integrity**

**Your Explanation:** "Integrity is we don't want our data itself to be tampered with, like an unauthorized user making changes to our account or changing the database credentials."​

**Evaluation:** This is a solid explanation. You've correctly identified that integrity involves protecting data from unauthorized modifications.​

**Improved Explanation:** "Integrity ensures that data remains accurate and unaltered, preventing unauthorized modifications such as changes to user accounts or database credentials.
​
###⚙️ **Availability**

**Your Explanation:** "Availability, which I learned with Kubernetes, is always keeping that service available to the customers, like how in Kubernetes when making a change to a manifest, the previous stable version is still up until the newer version is finally stable and working again."​

**Evaluation:** Excellent use of a real-world example! You've effectively illustrated how availability ensures continuous access to services.​

**Improved Explanation:** "Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible when needed. For instance, in Kubernetes, during updates, the system maintains the previous stable version to ensure continuous service until the new version is confirmed stable."
