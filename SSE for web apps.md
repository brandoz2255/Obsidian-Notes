The ideal approach for real‑time log/alert streaming from your Flask backend to a Next.js (or any front‑end) is to use **Server‑Sent Events (SSE)**.

- SSE is lightweight for one‑way communication and is perfect if you just need to push log updates from your server to the client. (If you ever need two‑way comms, then consider WebSockets.)
- Below is an updated version of your code that uses SSE to stream parsed alerts in JSON in real time. On the front end, you can consume these events using the standard `EventSource` API (or via your `TypeScript` arrays).

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import threading
import time
from flask import Flask, jsonify, Response
from queue import Queue

import parser  # Your parser module to follow snort logs

app = Flask(__name__)

# Use a thread-safe queue to hold alert messages
alert_queue = Queue()

def monitor_snort():
    """
    Monitor the Snort log file in real time.
    Uses parser.follow_snort_logs() to yield parsed alerts,
    then pushes each alert into a thread-safe queue.
    """
    log_file = "/var/log/snort/alert.fast"  # Adjust as needed
    for alert_data in parser.follow_snort_logs(log_file):
        if "error" in alert_data:
            message = alert_data["error"]
        else:
            message = f"SID: {alert_data.get('sid')} | Message: {alert_data.get('alert')}"
        print("CLI Alert:", message)  # Log to console
        alert_queue.put(message)
        time.sleep(0.1)  # Throttle if needed

@app.route("/start", methods=["GET"])
def start_monitoring():
    """
    Start the background thread that monitors Snort logs.
    """
    if not any(t.name == "snort_monitor" for t in threading.enumerate()):
        thread = threading.Thread(target=monitor_snort, name="snort_monitor", daemon=True)
        thread.start()
        return jsonify({"status": "Snort monitoring started"}), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({"status": "Monitoring already running"}), 200

@app.route("/stream")
def stream():
    """
    SSE endpoint that streams new alerts as JSON.
    Clients can subscribe to this endpoint to receive real-time updates.
    """
    def event_stream():
        while True:
            if not alert_queue.empty():
                message = alert_queue.get()
                # Wrap the message in a JSON object
                data = {"alert": message}
                yield f"data: {json.dumps(data)}\n\n"
            else:
                time.sleep(0.1)
    return Response(event_stream(), mimetype="text/event-stream")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000, debug=True)
```

### **How This Works**

- **Background Monitoring:**  
    The `monitor_snort()` function uses your `parser.follow_snort_logs(log_file)` to continuously watch for new Snort alerts. Each alert is pushed into a thread‑safe `Queue` (the `alert_queue`).
    
- **SSE Endpoint:**  
    The `/stream` endpoint creates an event stream that continuously checks the queue. When a new alert is available, it wraps it in a JSON object and yields it as an SSE message. The client will receive events like:

```json
{"alert": "SID: 12345 | Message: potential threat detected ..."}
```


**Starting the Monitor**:
The /start endpoint initiates the background thread if it isn’t already running.
