**1. Implement Monitoring and Visualization with Prometheus and Grafana**

- **Prometheus Setup**: Install Prometheus to collect metrics from your Minetest server and related infrastructure. Prometheus will scrape metrics and store them for analysis.
    
- **Grafana Integration**: Install Grafana to visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus. Grafana provides dashboards and alerting mechanisms to monitor system performance effectively.
    
- **Configuration**: Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your Minetest server. Then, set up Grafana to use Prometheus as a data source and create dashboards to visualize the metrics.

**2. Establish a CI/CD Pipeline for Modding Luanti**

- **Version Control**: Use Git to manage your modding codebase, ensuring all changes are tracked and versioned.
    
- **CI/CD Tool Selection**: Given your familiarity with GitHub Actions and considering industry adoption, **GitLab CI** is a suitable choice. It offers integrated CI/CD capabilities and is widely used in the industry.
    
    - **GitLab CI Advantages**:
        
        - Integrated with GitLab repositories, providing a seamless workflow.
        - User-friendly interface with straightforward pipeline configuration.
        - Built-in features for code review, issue tracking, and more.
    - **Comparison with Jenkins**:
        
        - Jenkins is highly extensible with a vast plugin ecosystem but can be complex to set up and maintain.
        - GitLab CI offers a more integrated and user-friendly experience, which can be advantageous for streamlined workflows.

- **Pipeline Configuration**:
    
    - **Build Stage**: Compile and package your mods.
    - **Test Stage**: Run automated tests to ensure mod functionality.
    - **Deploy Stage**: Use Ansible to deploy the updated mods to your Minetest server.
- **Automation**: Configure the pipeline to trigger on code commits or pull requests, ensuring continuous integration and deployment.
    

**3. Security Integration**

- **DevSecOps Practices**: Incorporate security checks into your CI/CD pipeline, such as static code analysis and vulnerability scanning, to ensure secure code deployment.

**4. Documentation and Training**

- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of your CI/CD processes, monitoring setups, and configurations.
    
- **Training**: Provide training sessions for your team to familiarize them with the tools and processes implemented.
