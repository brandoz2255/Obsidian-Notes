## Use Cases

1. For applications (binaries):
    
    - Commit both `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` to version control
    - This ensures reproducible builds across different machines
2. For libraries:
    
    - Commit `Cargo.toml`, but consider whether to commit `Cargo.lock`
    - The current recommendation is to do what's best for your project, but committing `Cargo.lock` is suggested as a starting point[4](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/29/committing-lockfiles.html)
3. For workspaces (projects with multiple related packages):
    
    - Use a single `Cargo.lock` at the workspace root to manage dependencies consistently across all member packages[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75884097/using-cargo-lock-to-effectively-manage-pull-dependency-versions-in-my-crates)

## Building Something

When building a Rust project:

1. `Cargo.toml` defines what dependencies you need
2. `Cargo.lock` ensures you get the exact same versions every time you build
