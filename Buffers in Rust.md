In Rust these are mainly used with interacting with C APIs or when working with raw memory. The `Buffer` struct in Rust is a continuous memory region that can be shared across thread boundaries.  

Creating a buffer from a Vector

```rust
let vec: Vec<u32> = vec![1, 2, 3];
let buffer = Buffer::from(vec);
```

Converting a buffer back to a vector

```rust
let vec: Vec<u32> = buffer.into_vec().unwrap();
```

- However this isn't exactly safe and Rust would catch this 

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

- `buffer.into_vec()`: This method call attempts to convert the `buffer` into a vector. The `into_vec` method is likely from the `Read` or `Buf` trait, which is implemented by various buffer types in Rust, such as `Vec<u8>` or `BytesMut`.
    
- `unwrap()`: This method is used to handle the `Result` that `into_vec` returns. If the conversion is successful, `unwrap` returns the resulting vector. If the conversion fails, `unwrap` will panic the program with an error message.
    
- `let vec: Vec<u32> = ...`: This assigns the resulting vector to a variable named `vec`, with a type annotation specifying that it should be a vector of `u32` values.

```rust
use byteorder::{ByteOrder, LittleEndian};

let mut vec: Vec<u32> = Vec::new();
for chunk in buffer.chunks(4) {
    if chunk.len() == 4 {
        vec.push(LittleEndian::read_u32(chunk));
    }
}
```

- This code reads the buffer 4 bytes at a time, interprets each chunk as a `u32` value in little-endian byte order, and adds it to the vector.
