### **Day 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity and Secure Software**

**Objective:** Introduce the basics of cybersecurity and the concept of secure software.

**Discussion Topics:**

- What is cybersecurity?
    - Importance of protecting data and systems.
    - Real-world examples of cyber attacks.
- Introduction to secure software.
    - Definition and importance.
    - Basic concepts of vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited.

**Hands-On Activity:**

- **Cybersecurity Scavenger Hunt:**
    - Create a list of cybersecurity-related terms and concepts (e.g., virus, hacker, firewall, encryption).
    - Have students search for these terms online and write down simple definitions.
    - Discuss their findings as a group.

### **Day 2: Understanding Common Vulnerabilities**

**Objective:** Learn about common software vulnerabilities and their impacts.

**Discussion Topics:**

- Overview of common vulnerabilities.
    - Explain in simple terms: SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
    - Real-world examples and consequences.

**Hands-On Activity:**

- **Interactive Vulnerability Examples:**
    - Use simple, safe web-based platforms like Google Gruyere (https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/) to demonstrate how these vulnerabilities work.
    - Guide students through identifying and understanding these vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

### **Day 3: Introduction to Secure Coding Practices**

**Objective:** Teach basic secure coding practices to avoid common vulnerabilities.

**Discussion Topics:**

- Importance of secure coding.
    - Validating user input.
    - Using strong authentication and authorization.
    - Proper error handling.

**Hands-On Activity:**

- **Simple Coding Exercise:**
    - Provide a basic HTML form that is vulnerable to XSS.
    - Guide students to modify the form to sanitize user input and prevent XSS attacks.
    - Discuss the changes and why they improve security.

### **Day 4: Using Tools for Secure Software Assessment**

**Objective:** Introduce basic tools used in secure software assessment.

**Discussion Topics:**

- Overview of static and dynamic analysis tools.
    - Explain in simple terms how these tools help identify vulnerabilities.
    - Introduce tools like OWASP ZAP for dynamic analysis and SonarQube for static analysis.

**Hands-On Activity:**

- **Tool Demonstration:**
    - Perform a live demo of using OWASP ZAP to scan a simple web application for vulnerabilities.
    - Let students follow along and try running their own scans on a provided sample web app.

### **Day 5: Putting It All Together**

**Objective:** Review the weekâ€™s lessons and apply knowledge in a final project.

**Discussion Topics:**

- Recap of the key concepts covered during the week.
    - Importance of continuous learning in cybersecurity.
    - Encourage students to explore further on their own.

**Hands-On Activity:**

- **Mini Project:**
    - Provide a simple, pre-built web application with multiple vulnerabilities.
    - Have students work in groups to identify and fix as many vulnerabilities as possible using what they've learned.
    - Each group presents their findings and fixes.

### **Additional Tips:**

- **Engagement:** Keep sessions interactive with lots of questions and encourage students to share their thoughts.
- **Simplify Concepts:** Use analogies and simple language to explain complex ideas.
- **Encourage Curiosity:** Provide resources for further learning and encourage students to explore cybersecurity on their own.
