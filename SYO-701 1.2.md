# CIA Triad 

This is the Three core principles of security **`Confidentiality`** **`Integrity`** and **`Availability`** . 

1. **Confidentiality**: this principle ensures that only those who are allowed to access the info can
2. **Integrity**: this principle ensures that information is accurate and complete and has not been tampered with in any means by unauthorized access
3. **Availability**: Ensures that the processes are usable by trust worthy individualist authorized users. 


**Exam Tips**: For the Security+ exam, focus on understanding the three principles of the CIA Triad and how they relate to information security. Be prepared to explain the importance of each principle and how they are applied in the design and implementation of security policies and controls.


# Confidentiality 

- **Encryption**:  Is the process of converting plain text data to unreadable data to prevent unauthorized access this technique is used to ensure security of data

1. Purpose: The primary Purpose od encryption is to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access
2. Types of Encryption: 
	1. **Symmetric Encryption:** This type of encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. 
		1. Fast and efficient but requires secure method for the key exchange
	2. **Asymmetric Encryption**: AKA public key encryption this type uses two different keys a Public key and a private key 
3.  Its Importance: its crucial for protecting sensitive information such as financial data and personal info 

**Exam Tips**: For the Security+ exam, focus on understanding the purpose and types of encryption. Be` prepared to explain how encryption works, `the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and the importance of encryption in protecting sensitive information.

Another part of Confidentiality is [[SYO-701 1.1]] **`Access controls`**


- **Two-Factor Authentication** (2FA): Is a security process that has two different types of accessing the users identity One is the `password` 
	- and the other is the **token or device** such as a phone 
	- Another method is themselves with Biometrics 
- **Purpose**: The primary purpose is to provide an additional layer of security by requiring two forms of authentication

2. **Types of 2FA**:
    - **Something You Know**: This is the first factor and typically involves a password or PIN.
    - **Something You Have**: This is the second factor and can include a physical token (like a smart card or a hardware token), a software token (like a mobile app), or a device (like a smartphone).
    - **Something You Are**: This is the second factor and involves biometric verification, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or voice recognition.

# Integrity 

- **Hashing**: is when a computer converts plain text message itno a fixed size of string bytes and makes it into a unreadable hash code 
	- used in passwords ,integrity checks and digital signitures
- **Digital Signatures**:  They are digital cryptographic mechanisms used to verify the authenticity and integrity of documents or messages. 
	- Used to ensure the authenticity and integrity of digital documents or messages 
		-  they make sure that the data has not been tampered with and that it comes from a verified source 
	- They use *asymmetric encryption* using a private to encrypt a hash of data. 
	- There are different types of digital signatures, 
	- including those used for document signing, email signing, and code signing
- **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: Digital signatures that are a part of PKI, which is a set of roles, policies, hardware, software, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption. 

Digital Signatures are used in protocols such as SSL/TLS 

**Digital Certificates**: these are electronic documents that prove the ownership of the digital signatures!

**(CA): Certificate Authority**: is the third party source that provides the Digital Certificate

- used to identify the integrity of the digital signatures and to establish a secure connection between the two parties

- Each certificate contains the public key and identity of the certificate holder and the digital signature of the CA


# Availability 

- **Information**: This is pretty straight forward in which it refers to the assurance that information and related services are accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized entity. 
	- Strategies for ensuring availability include redundancy (having backup systems in place), l
	- oad balancing (distributing network traffic across multiple servers), 
	- and regular maintenance and monitoring of systems to prevent failures.
	- risks to availability, such as hardware failures, software bugs, and cyber attacks, is crucial.

- Redundancy: Involves setting up backups for critical components or systems to ensure that there are alternative resources available if one fails. 
- **Network Redundancy**: Prevents network downtime by creating multiple pathways for data to travel. Technologies like **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)** or **link aggregation (LACP)** can be used to implement redundant network links.
- **Hardware Redundancy**: Ensures critical hardware components have backup counterparts ready to take over in case of failure. This includes redundant power supplies in servers.
- **Data Storage Redundancy**: Safeguards data against loss due to hardware failures or other issues, often achieved through technologies such as ***RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks).***
- **Application Redundancy**: Involves deploying duplicate instances of critical applications to ensure continuous service availability, often achieved through load balancers.

- **Fault Tolerance**: Refers to the ability of a system to continue operating correctly in case of a system failure of some components. 
	- A system in place in case something bad happens to the system the operations can continue as normal 
	- **Failover Mechanisms**: These are designed to automatically redirect traffic or workload from a failed component to a redundant one, allowing for uninterrupted service availability. 
	- Systems employ mechanisms to detect errors or failures and initiate recovery procedures. 
	- These mechanisms can range from simple error checks to sophisticated algorithms that identify and correct errors in real-time, ensuring that the system can recover from failures and continue operating.\



One fundamental policy needed to know for the exam is **Zero** trust which means never trust always verify!
