CIA Triad 
- has nothing to do with the CIA organization 
	- Combination of principle 
		- Sometimes called the AIC Triad
	- `Confidentiality `
	 - `Integrity`
	- `Availability`

Confidentiality:
- Encryption : tied to C of CIA 
- Access controls tied to C 
- Two Factor authentication 

Integrity:
- How data is stored 
- hashing: Tied to I 
- Digital Signatures
- Certificates : Digital Signature 
- Non repudiation

Availability:
- Infomation 
- Redundancy : related to A 
- Fault tolerance 
- Patching 


# CIA Triad 

This is the Three core principles of security **`Confidentiality`** **`Integrity`** and **`Availability`** . 

1. **Confidentiality**: this principle ensures that only those who are allowed to access the info can
2. **Integrity**: this principle ensures that information is accurate and complete and has not been tampered with in any means by unauthorized access
3. **Availability**: Ensures that the processes are usable by trust worthy individualist authorized users. 


**Exam Tips**: For the Security+ exam, focus on understanding the three principles of the CIA Triad and how they relate to information security. Be prepared to explain the importance of each principle and how they are applied in the design and implementation of security policies and controls.


# Confidentiality 

- **Encryption**:  Is the process of converting plain text data to unreadable data to prevent unauthorized access this technique is used to ensure security of data

1. Purpose: The primary Purpose od encryption is to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access
2. Types of Encryption: 
	1. **Symmetric Encryption:** This type of encryption usees the same key for both encryption and decryption. 
		1. Fast and efficient but requires secure method for the key exchange
	2. **Asymmetric Encryption**: AKA public key encryption this type uses two different keys a Public key and a private key 
3.  Its Importance: its crucial for protecting sensitive information such as financial data and personal info 

**Exam Tips**: For the Security+ exam, focus on understanding the purpose and types of encryption. Be prepared to explain how encryption works, the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and the importance of encryption in protecting sensitive information.

Another part of Confidentiality is [[SYO-701 1.1]] **`Access controls`**


- **Two-Factor Authentication** (2FA): Is a security process that has two different types of accessing the users identity One is the `password` 
	- and the other is the **token or device** such as a phone 
	- Another method is themselves with Biometrics 
- **Purpose**: The primary purpose is to provide an additional layer of security by requiring two forms of authentication

2. **Types of 2FA**:
    - **Something You Know**: This is the first factor and typically involves a password or PIN.
    - **Something You Have**: This is the second factor and can include a physical token (like a smart card or a hardware token), a software token (like a mobile app), or a device (like a smartphone).
    - **Something You Are**: This is the second factor and involves biometric verification, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or voice recognition.

# Integrity 

- Hashing: is when a computer converts plain text message itno a fixed size of string bytes and makes it into a unreadable hash code 
	- used in passwords ,integrity checks and digital signitures
