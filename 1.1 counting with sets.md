### Fleet 
- added two power sets maybe 
- count all the large collection of things quickly and precisely
	- for example in a group of 10 people everyone shakes hand with everyone else exactly once how many handshakes took place 

Basic Example:
```python
A restaurant offers 8 appetizers and 14 entrées. How many
choices do you have if:
(a) you will eat one dish, either an appetizer or an entrée?
(b) you are extra hungry and want to eat both an appetizer
and an entrée?
```

## Basics 
1.1 is counting sets essentially counting the number of elements in a set and  the total number of possible outcomes in a given scenario.  

#### Example 

```Python
 for example in a group of 10 people everyone shakes hand with everyone else exactly once how many handshakes took place 
```

- In this example we got a group of ten people and each person shakes hands with every other person at least once
- since it is ten people we can see this as a list from 1 to 10 with each number representing individual people
	- we have answered this before refer to chapter 0 but in short its $9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1$ $= 48$ 
	- Now here we can see the counting with sets not that great of example but ->

# keypoints


- **`Additive Principle`**: This is also known as the rule of sum in which that if event `A` can occur in `m` ways and event `B` can occur in n **`disjoint`**(`mutually exclusive`)  ways
	- this means that the total number of Event A or B can occur is **`m + n`** 


Example: 
```C++
Let's break it down with an example:

Imagine you have two different routes to travel from your home to school: Route A and Route B.

- Route A has 3 possible ways to reach school (e.g., taking the highway, taking the local roads, or using public transportation).
- Route B has 4 possible ways to reach school (e.g., walking, biking, taking a taxi, or carpooling).

Now, according to the additive principle, the total number of ways you can travel to school either by Route A or Route B is 3+4=7 .
```

- This is because you can't travel on both A and B simultaneously 
- In this case we have to choose either A or B  A has 3 ways for B has 4 ways meaning the possible outcomes are 7 

## Multiplicative Principle
- **`Multiplicative principle`**: The rule of product states that if event `A` can occur in `m` ways than for each `m` possibilities for event `A`, event `B` can occur in n ways 
	- how they can occur together is $m \times n$ 

Example: 

```C++
Let's illustrate this with an example:

Suppose you're choosing an outfit for the day, and you have the following choices:

- For tops (event A), you have 4 different shirts you can wear.
- For bottoms (event B), you have 3 different pairs of pants you can wear.
```

- in the multiplicative rule the total number of outfits you can create by choosing one top and one bottom is $4 \times 3 = 12$

## Cartesian product

- **`Cartesian Product`**: is a fundamental concept used to combine sets when we take the `Cartesian` product of two sets we essentially create new set containing all possible ordered pairs 
	- where the first element in each pair comes from the first set and the second element from the second set.
		- In general if set `A` has m elements and set `B` has `n` elements then $A \times B$  will have $m \times n$ ordered pairs 
			- The **`Cartesian product`** is not limited to just two sets; you can take the `Cartesian` product of any number of sets. For example, if you have three sets `A, B, and C,` the Cartesian product $A×B×C$  would consist of ordered triples, with one element from each set.

Example: 
```C++
Let's break it down with an example:

Consider two sets:

- Set A = {1, 2}
- Set B = {a, b, c}

To find the Cartesian product of these sets, you pair each element of set A with each element of set B:

- (1, a), (1, b), (1, c)
- (2, a), (2, b), (2, c)

These ordered pairs constitute the Cartesian product of sets A and B. You can represent the Cartesian product as a new set:

A×B={(1,a),(1,b),(1,c),(2,a),(2,b),(2,c)}A×B={(1,a),(1,b),(1,c),(2,a),(2,b),(2,c)}
```


# Cardinality of a Union

- **`Cardinality of a Union`** : The cardinality of a union A U B is the number of elements in combined sets when you take the union operation 

example:

``` C++ 
For example, if:

- Set A = {1, 2, 3}
- Set B = {3, 4, 5}

Then, the union of sets A and B would be A∪B={1,2,3,4,5}

The cardinality of the union, denoted by ∣A∪B∣∣A∪B∣, represents the number of elements in the union set. In this case, ∣A∪B∣∣A∪B∣ would be 5 because there are 5 unique elements in the union set.
```

*3 sets* 

```C++ 
Now, let's extend this concept to the cardinality of the union of three sets. Suppose you have three sets, A, B, and C. The union of these sets, denoted by

A ∪ B ∪ C, contains all the unique elements that are present in set A, set B, set C, or any combination of these sets.

For example, if:

- Set A = {1, 2, 3}
- Set B = {3, 4, 5}
- Set C = {5, 6, 7}

Then, the union of sets A, B, and C would be A∪B∪C ={1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
```

- The cardinality of the union, denoted by $∣A∪B∪C∣$, represents the number of elements in the union set. In this case, $∣A∪B∪C∣$ would be `7` because there are `7` unique elements in the union set.


## Bit strings 
**`Bit strings`**: In discrete mathematics, bit strings are sequences of binary digits (`bits`) that are used to represent various mathematical objects or concepts.

1. **Representation of Integers**: In discrete mathematics, bit strings are commonly used to represent integers in binary form. Each bit in the string corresponds to a power of 2, and by setting bits to 0 or 1, you can represent any non-negative integer.
    
    For example, the bit string "1011" represents the integer $1×2^3+0×2^2+1×2^1+1×2^0=11$
    
2. **Combinatorial Objects**: Bit strings are often used to represent subsets of a finite set. If you have a set with nn elements, you can represent each subset using a bit string of length nn, where each bit corresponds to an element of the set.
    
    For example, if you have a set with three elements {a,b,c}{a,b,c}, the bit string "101" might represent the subset {a,c}{a,c}, where the first bit corresponds to aa, the second to bb, and the third to cc.
    
3. **Boolean Operations**: Bit strings can also be manipulated using boolean operations such as AND, OR, and XOR. These operations are often used in combinatorial problems and algorithms to manipulate sets or perform bitwise operations.
    
    For example, if you have two bit strings "1010" and "1100", performing an AND operation between them would result in the bit string "1000", indicating the common elements between two sets represented by these bit strings.
