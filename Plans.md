- **Backend Development (Python):**
    
    - **Setup Base Environment:** Start by setting up a Python environment, possibly using a virtual environment like `venv` or `conda`.
    - **IDS Core:** Develop the core functionality of your IDS, which includes capturing and analyzing network data. You might want to integrate existing tools like `scapy` for packet capture and analysis.
    - **Machine Learning Integration:** Implement ML models for anomaly detection. Libraries like `scikit-learn` or `TensorFlow` can be used depending on the complexity of the model you need.
    - **CLI Interface:** Create a CLI to interact with the IDS, allowing users to start, stop, and configure settings directly from the terminal.
- **Dockerization:**
    
    - **Docker Setup:** Package your Python application in a Docker container to isolate your IDS environment and make it easily deployable. This is where Docker shines, allowing you to maintain consistent environments across different systems.
    - **Docker Compose:** Use Docker Compose to manage multi-container setups, especially if you plan to separate different components of your IDS (like database, backend, and frontend).
- **Frontend Development (React):**
    
    - **Initial Setup:** Start by setting up a React project, possibly using `create-react-app`.
    - **GUI Development:** Build the user interface that interacts with the backend. This might include views for real-time data, alerts, configurations, and historical analysis.
    - **Integration with Backend:** Use APIs to connect your React frontend with the Python backend. You could use `axios` or `fetch` for making API requests.
- **Additional Considerations:**
    
    - **Electron Integration:** If you choose to make a desktop application using Electron, integrate it with your React app to wrap the GUI in an Electron shell.
    - **Security Measures:** Since itâ€™s an IDS, ensure that both the data transmission between the frontend and backend and the stored data are secured.
