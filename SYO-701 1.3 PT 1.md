# Change management and policies


**Change Advisory Board (CAB)**:

- *Evaluates and prioritizes the approval of security policies.*
- Ensures changes align with organizational goals and security standards.

**Change Management**:

- *Plans, implements, and monitors changes to protect organizations from unforeseen consequences.*
- Every change should have an assigned owner to oversee and be responsible for it.

**Impact Analysis**:

- **Definition**: *Understanding the potential impact of changes to protect systems.*
- **Importance**: Analyzing how a change might impact the organization is crucial.

**Change Process**:

- *Changes should follow a defined process*.
- Include steps like `planning, impact analysis, implementation, testing, and documentation.`

**Testing Changes**:

- **Test Results**: *It’s important to test changes before fully implementing them to identify any issues.*
- Scheduled testing ensures changes won’t disrupt normal operations.

**Maintenance Window**:

- *Scheduled time for performing updates, fixes, and maintenance tasks.*
- Ensures minimal disruption to services.

**Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)**:

- *A rulebook that guides how tasks should be done.*
- Ensures consistency and compliance with policies.

**Backout Plans**:

- *Steps to reverse a change if unforeseen consequences occur.*
- Essential for minimizing risks and restoring systems quickly.

**Allow Lists/Deny Lists**:

- **Allow Lists**: *Lists that permit certain activities.*
- **Deny Lists**: *Lists that block certain activities.*
- Used to control and restrict actions that could lead to vulnerabilities.

**Downtime Planning**:

- *Plan for potential disruptions in services.*
- Includes strategies for minimizing and managing downtime.

**Service/Application Restarts**:

- *Procedures for restarting services or applications after changes.*
- Ensures systems return to normal operation smoothly.

**Legacy Applications**:

- *Older applications that may be slower and have outdated security measures.*
- Often require special handling and updates.

**Dependencies**:

- *Identify and manage dependencies between systems and applications.*
- Ensures that changes in one area don’t negatively impact others.

**Version Control**:

- *Document every change that occurs in the systems (similar to using Git for coding).*
- Helps track changes, roll back if needed, and maintain historical records.

**Approval Process**:

- *Proposed changes must be documented with reasoning.*
- Reviewed and approved by relevant stakeholders or the CAB.

**Ownership**:

- *Each change must have an assigned owner responsible for its success.*
