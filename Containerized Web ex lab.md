Select a set of vulnerable applications and tools that are commonly used for security testing. Here are some recommendations:

- **OWASP Juice Shop**: A modern web application intentionally designed with security vulnerabilities.
- **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)**: A PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable.

Since we already made the Juice Shop one 

with the CLI tools using nmap, nikto, and others 

to use GUI tools theres two options 

- Containerizing a Script that downloads the GUI applications we need to exploit these machines 
- Also using that specific Docker command that pushes the container on a Xorg server or Wayland server python script might be more useful 
	- for those who use Windows and MacOS

- GUI apps 
	- Burpe Suite 
	- ZAP
