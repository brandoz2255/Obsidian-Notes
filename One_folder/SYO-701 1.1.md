## Control Types

### Preventive Controls

Preventive controls stop attackers from accessing systems and data.

- **Access Control:** Ensures only authorized users can access systems.
    - **Mechanisms:** User Authentication (passwords, biometrics), ACLs, RBAC
- **Firewalls:** Monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.
- **Encryption:** Protects data by converting it into an unreadable format.
    - **Types:** Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption
- **Patching and Updating:** Regularly updating software to fix vulnerabilities.
- **Security Awareness Training:** Educating users to recognize and prevent security threats.

### Deterrent Controls

Deterrent controls discourage potential attackers from attempting to breach security.

- **Warning Banners:** Inform users and potential attackers that unauthorized access is prohibited.
- **Security Guards:** Physical presence to deter unauthorized access.
- **Fencing and Barriers:** Physical obstacles to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Security Cameras:** Surveillance to monitor and record activities.

### Detective Controls

Detective controls identify and report security breaches.

- **Log Analysis:** Reviewing logs from servers, firewalls, and IDS for signs of malicious activity.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Monitor network traffic for suspicious activities.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Centralized platform for real-time monitoring and analysis of security events.
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Detects unauthorized changes to files.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies deviations from normal behavior using statistical analysis or machine learning.

### Corrective Controls

Corrective controls respond to and fix security incidents.

- **Purpose:** Restore normal operations and minimize damage after an incident.
- **Types:**
    - **Recovery:** System backups, data recovery, restoring from backups.
    - **Documentation:** Post-incident reviews to identify root causes and improve future security.

### Compensating Controls

Compensating controls provide alternative measures when primary controls are not feasible.

- **Purpose:** Mitigate risks associated with vulnerabilities.
- **Types:**
    - **Dual Controls:** Two separate controls for a single function.
    - **Redundancy:** Backup systems to take over if primary systems fail.
    - **Monitoring and Alerting:** Systems to detect and alert unusual activities.

### Directive Controls

Directive controls involve policies, procedures, and guidelines for managing security.

- **Purpose:** Establish rules for accessing and using information and resources.
- **Types:**
    - **Policies:** Define rules and guidelines for managing and protecting information.
    - **Procedures:** Detailed instructions for implementing policies.
    - **Guidelines:** Recommendations for best practices in implementing procedures.

### Control Categories

- **Technical Controls:** Implemented through technology.
    - **Examples:** Firewalls, encryption, IDS
- **Managerial Controls:** Administrative controls that manage and oversee security.
    - **Examples:** Security policies, risk assessments, security awareness training
- **Operational Controls:** Day-to-day procedures and mechanisms.
    - **Examples:** Incident response plans, physical access controls, backups
- **Physical Controls:** Physical measures to protect systems and data.
    - **Examples:** Security guards, fences, surveillance cameras
