### Day 1: Introduction to Coding and Basics

1. **Introduction to JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**:
    
    - **Hello World** in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
    - Basic data types and functions in JavaScript.
    - Brief explanation of CSS (styling HTML elements).
    - basics of VS code the difference between a IDE and a Text editor  
1. **AI Buddy for HTML and CSS**:
    
    - Show how AI tools can help automate HTML and CSS creation.
    - Encourage students to freestyle with JS, providing debugging instructions.
3. **Additional Tools**:
    
    - **Visual Studio Code**: Integrated development environment (IDE) for coding.
    - **Git/GitHub**: So  that I can share some of the basic code that have errors and how they can fix it to show me I'll have them clone it and once its done the fixed version they can create their own repo and save it to github! to also learn about git and github. 
    - **VIM**: Also show them the Vim text editor alternative
    - **Kate**: Another Text editor choice wh
    -
    - **CodePen**: Online code editor for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    - **Beautify Tools**: Online code beautifier to format code properly.

**AI Enhancement**: Use AI tools to automate HTML/CSS generation, allowing students to focus more on learning JavaScript.

### Day 2: Common Coding Flaws and Fuzzing

1. **Identifying Basic Common Coding Flaws**:
    
    - Teach manual identification of SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities.
    - Discuss why these vulnerabilities are dangerous and how they can be exploited.
    - Provide code examples to practice identifying flaws.
2. **Automated Fuzzing**:
    
    - Introduction to fuzzing and its importance.
    - Set up and run a simple fuzzing example using `Jsfuzz`.
    - Explain how fuzzing automates flaw detection.
3. **Additional Tools**:
    
    - **Burp Suite**: Web vulnerability scanner for manual testing.
    - **Nmap**: Network scanning tool to identify open ports and services.
    - **Postman**: API testing tool for sending requests and analyzing responses.

**AI Enhancement**: Use AI to identify vulnerability patterns from manual and fuzzing results, enhancing understanding of common security flaw characteristics.

### Day 3: Penetration Testing for Web Applications

1. **Using OWASP ZAP**:
    
    - Introduction to penetration testing and its importance.
    - Basic usage of OWASP ZAP to scan for vulnerabilities.
    - Show how to set up OWASP ZAP and run a basic scan.
2. **Additional Tools**:
    
    - **Kali Linux**: Operating system with pre-installed penetration testing tools.
    - **Metasploit**: Framework for developing and executing exploit code.
    - **Nikto**: Web server scanner to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
3. **Bonus Material**: Automate penetration testing using OWASP ZAP scripts.
4. **Juice Shop**: 
	1. Explain what Juice Shop is 
	2. Explain how to download and  run Juice shop 
	3. Depending on time I'll show them how to git clone and compile it from source but if time is running out just docker pull then docker run and boom pent testing time.
		1. As well as explain Docker and why its used and how its different from building it and running it from source. 
		2. Why its also useful to know docker
    

**AI Enhancement**: Automate penetration testing to improve efficiency and accuracy.

### Day 4: Integrated Quality Assurance Testing

1. **Quality Assurance Testing**:
    
    - Analyzing user authentication processes.
    - Identifying potential security weaknesses in authentication.
	    - Such as SQL injection 
	    - And other wealnesses 
    - Discuss common issues like insecure password storage or weak password policies.
2. **AI Enhancements**:
    
    - Using AI to simulate attacks and improve security.
    - Hands-on practice with AI tools for security assessment.
    - Provide examples where AI tools enhance authentication processes.
3. **Additional Tools**:
    
    - **Jenkins**: Continuous integration tool to automate testing.
    - **Selenium**: Automated testing framework for web applications.
    - **OWASP Dependency-Check**: Tool to identify vulnerable dependencies.
