In this part of the Docker training its just the basic usage of Docker and how to use it and command it on what to do 

Docker is an Open-Source Project that automates the deployment of applications 

- you can run these independent containers either locally or in the cloud 
- there is alot of commands in docker but we will look at just the top commands
- `docker run <image_name>`
	- used to run containers from an image 
	- combination of the docker start and docker create commands 
- `docker run --name <container_name> <image_name>`
- `docker run redis`
- `docker pull <image_name>`
	- This command allows to pull any image you want 
	- which only if its present in the registry of docker or *Docker Hub*
- `docker ps`
	- kinda like ls but for docker just lists all of the running containers 
		- `-a` flag means show all the containers stopped or running 
		- `-l` flag shows the latest containers
		- `-q` shows only the id of the containers 
- `docker ps [options...]` 
- `docker stop <container_ID>`
	- this command allows for you to stop a container in case it crashes or if you just want to stop it
- `docker start <container_ID>`
	- this command allows you to start the stopped container again  
- `docker rm`
	- this container allows fort he deletion of a container you can use the id or the name of the container
		- `-f` flag allows to remove the container forcefully 
		- `-v` flag allows you to remove the volumes
		- `-l` flagremoves the specific link 
- `docker rmi <image ID/ image name>` 
	- This command allows for the deletion of the image in docker 
	- Helps with freeing up space by removing useless images from the docker local storage
- `docker images`
	- lists all of the puiled images that are present in the system 
- `docker exec`
	- this command allows you to run new commands in a container
	- Only works whent he container is running 
		- `-d` flag is for running commands in the background
		- `-i` flag will keep the STDIN open 
		- `-e` flag sets the environment variables 
- docker ports (mapping)
- in order to use a container in docker we must map the ports onto our host 
- `docker run -d -p <port_on_host>`
- `docker login`
	- allows you to login and authenticate with docker hub so that we can push and pull our images at will 
- `docker push <image name/ image id>`
	- once we make a image using a docker file we need to store the image remotely 
	- DockeHub is where one would do it 
	- This is the command to do it
- `docker build -t image_name:tag`
	- This is the build to build docker images using dockerfile
- `docker stop container_name_or_id` 
	- we can stop a container or start wherever we want to do maintenance for the containers with this command
- `docker stop container1 container2 container3` 
	- instead of stopping a single container we can stop multiple at a time 
- `docker restart container_name_or_id` 
	-  this restarts the container id if one detects errors or if it fails to start 
- `docker inspect container_name/id`
	- can debug the containers errors in real time with this command 
- `docker commit container_name_or_id` 
	- we can make updates to the containers with this command

### Docker Commands Overview

Docker allows you to run containers either locally or in the cloud. While Docker offers a vast array of commands, this guide focuses on the most essential ones.

#### Running Containers

- **`docker run <image_name>`**: Runs a container from a specified image. This command is a combination of the `docker start` and `docker create` commands.
    
    - **Example**: `docker run redis` runs a container from the Redis image.
- **`docker run --name <container_name> <image_name>`**: Runs a container with a specified name.
    

#### Managing Images

- **`docker pull <image_name>`**: Pulls an image from Docker Hub or another Docker registry. This command is used to download an image only if it exists in the registry.
    
- **`docker rmi <image_ID/image_name>`**: Deletes an image from the local Docker storage, which helps free up space by removing unused images.
    
- **`docker images`**: Lists all the images that have been pulled and are present on the system.
    

#### Managing Containers

- **`docker ps [options...]`**: Lists all running containers. Various options can modify the output:
    
    - `-a`: Shows all containers, both stopped and running.
    - `-l`: Shows the most recently created container.
    - `-q`: Displays only the container IDs.
- **`docker stop <container_ID>`**: Stops a running container. Useful for stopping a container that has crashed or that you no longer need to run.
    
- **`docker start <container_ID>`**: Starts a stopped container, allowing you to resume its operations.
    
- **`docker rm <container_ID/name>`**: Removes a container by its ID or name.
    
    - `-f`: Forces the removal of a running container.
    - `-v`: Removes associated volumes.
    - `-l`: Removes a specific link.
- **`docker exec`**: Executes commands inside a running container.
    
    - `-d`: Runs commands in the background.
    - `-i`: Keeps STDIN open.
    - `-e`: Sets environment variables.
- **`docker ports (mapping)`**: Maps container ports to host ports for accessing the containerâ€™s services from the host.
    
    - **Example**: `docker run -d -p <host_port>:<container_port>`.
- **`docker stop container1 container2 container3`**: Stops multiple containers at once, which is useful for managing several containers simultaneously.
    
- **`docker restart <container_ID/name>`**: Restarts a container, which is helpful for debugging or if the container fails to start.
    
- **`docker inspect <container_ID/name>`**: Provides detailed information about a container, which is useful for real-time debugging.
    

#### Image and Container Management

- **`docker commit <container_ID/name>`**: Commits changes to a container, allowing you to update or modify an existing container.
    
- **`docker build -t <image_name:tag>`**: Builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile and tags it with a specific name.
    

#### Docker Hub and Image Sharing

- **`docker login`**: Authenticates your Docker client with Docker Hub, allowing you to push and pull images.
    
- **`docker push <image_name/image_id>`**: Pushes an image to a remote registry, such as Docker Hub, after it has been built and tagged locally.
