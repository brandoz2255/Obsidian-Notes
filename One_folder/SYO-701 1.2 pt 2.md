- **Zero Trust** : is a security concept that assumes no user or device is trusted by default, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the network perimeter.
	- Zero Trust is a security model that requires verification for every access request, regardless of the user's location or the device they are using.

- **Key Components**:  key components of Zero Trust, such as:
	- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: This is crucial for Zero Trust as it involves verifying the identity of users and devices before granting access.
	- **Microsegmentation**: This involves dividing the network into smaller segments to limit the spread of potential threats.
	- **Least Privilege Access**: Ensuring that users have only the minimum levels of access necessary to perform their tasks.

- **Benefits and Challenges**: implementing Zero Trust, such as enhanced security and reduced risk of data breaches.
	- Also, be aware of the challenges, including the need for continuous monitoring and the potential for increased complexity in managing access controls.
- **Implementation Strategies**: This includes leveraging technologies like multi-factor authentication (MFA), encryption, and advanced threat detection systems.

## Deception technology
- **Deception technology**: is a strategic approach used in Cybersecurity to mislead attackers, making it harder for them to gain unauthorized access to a network
	- It involves creating illusions or traps that can help security analysts identify and respond to threats more effectively.

Technologies such as: 
- **Honeypots**: These are decoy systems designed to mimic real systems and attract attackers. They are used to gather information about attackers' methods and to detect and analyze malware.

- **Honeynet**: A larger network of Honeypots 

- **Darknets**: These are portions of a network's IP address space that are set aside and not used by legitimate systems. Any activity directed to these addresses is likely to be malicious, allowing security teams to focus on potential threats.

- **Honeytokens**: These are fake data or credentials that appear to be valuable to attackers. They are placed in systems to lure attackers and help identify their methods and targets. 
	- could also be named breadcrumbs 


## AAA {protocols}
- **AAA** stands for:  **`Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting`** It is a security framework that ensures that users are who they claim to be (`Authentication`), have the right to access resources (`Authorization`), and their actions are recorded (`Accounting`). This framework is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of information systems.

- **Authentication**: This process verifies the identity of a user, device, or system. 
	- It often involves the use of credentials such as usernames and passwords, but can also include more advanced methods like biometrics or tokens.

- **Authorization**: Once a user is authenticated, authorization determines what resources the user is allowed to access and what actions they can perform on those resources. 
	- This is typically managed through access control lists (`ACLs`) and role-based access control (`RBAC`).

- **Accounting**: This involves tracking and logging the activities of users and systems within an information system. 
	- Accounting records can include login times, logout times, and the actions performed by users. 
		- This information is crucial for auditing, forensics, and understanding user behavior.

***Goals***:
- **Understanding AAA**: For the Security+ exam, it's essential to understand the principles of AAA and how they are applied in securing information systems. 
	- You should be able to explain the purpose of each component (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) and how they work together to ensure security.


- **Video surveillance**: is a technology used to monitor and record video footage from a fixed or mobile camera.
	- providing continuous monitoring of areas such as parking lots, entrances, and other high-traffic areas. 
	- Video surveillance can be used for various purposes, including security, safety, and compliance with regulations. I
	- It involves the use of cameras, recording devices, and software to capture, store, and analyze video data.

- **Access control vestibules**: also known as mantraps, are a critical component of physical security systems designed to prevent unauthorized individuals from following authorized individuals into facilities with controlled access.
	- This is particularly effective in *preventing* `piggybacking` or `tailgating`, where *unauthorized individuals gain access* to a facility **`by following authorized individuals through the doors`**. 

- **Understanding Access Control Vestibules**: You should be able to explain how they prevent unauthorized access by creating a controlled space between two sets of doors and how they can be automated or managed by security guards.
	- Familiarize yourself with the different types of interlocking door controllers and how they can be used to manage access.

- **NIST Control Statement**: The NIST Control Statement for Access Control Vestibules (PE-3(8)) emphasizes the importance of employing access control vestibules at organization-defined locations within the facility.
	- This highlights the need for a strategic approach to implementing these systems, considering the specific security requirements of different areas within a facility.

- **Non-repudiation**: is a security concept that` ensures `that no party `involved in a transaction can deny the authenticity` of their actions or the integrity of the data exchanged.
	- It provides assurance that the sender of information is provided with proof of delivery,
	- the recipient is provided with proof of the senderâ€™s identity, so neither can later deny having processed the information.
	- This principle is crucial in various contexts, including legal agreements, financial transactions, and secure communications,
	- where it's essential to verify the origin and integrity of data and to prevent parties from denying their involvement in a transaction or communication.

- **Audit trails**: also known as audit logs, are records of activities that occur within a system. 
	- They track events such as log-on attempts, file access, network connections, and other operations, providing a detailed history of actions taken within the system.

- You should be able to explain how audit trails track system activities and provide a means to monitor and investigate security incidents.

- **Management Practices**: logging policies, implementing a centralized logging system, using standardized log formats, encrypting log data, and regularly reviewing and analyzing logs.

- **Security Identifier (SID)**: is a unique value used in Windows computing and Microsoft Active Directory (AD) to identify any security entity that the Windows operating system can authenticate.
	- This includes user accounts, computer accounts, processes initiated by these accounts, or security groups
	- SIDs are stored in a security descriptor data structure along with any discretionary access control lists (`ACLs`) and system `ACLs`.

- **SID Structure**: Familiarize yourself with the structure of a SID, which includes a `revision level`, identifier authority, and subauthorities.
	- The identifier authority specifies the highest level of authority that can issue SIDs for a particular type of security principal, 
	- while the subauthorities hold the most important information, identifying a domain and a particular account or group relative to that domain.

- **SID Usage**: users log on to a Windows system, the system generates an access token that includes the user's SID, the SIDs of any groups the user belongs to


- **Authorization models**: are frameworks that define how access to resources is granted to users or systems within a network or system.
	- These models are crucial for ensuring that only authorized users have access to specific resources, thereby maintaining the security and integrity of the system.
	- Authorization models can vary significantly depending on the system or network
	- generally involve the use of access control lists (ACLs), security identifiers (SIDs), and other security mechanisms to manage permissions.
- **Active Directory Authorization**:  used in Active Directory (AD), which is a directory service implemented by Microsoft for Windows domain networks.
	- AD uses a combination of Kerberos and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for authentication and authorization.
	- Understanding how AD uses these protocols for authorization is crucial, as it aids in effective role-based access control (RBAC) and prevents unauthorized access to AD [5](https://www.strongdm.com/what-is/active-directory-authentication).
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Be aware of the concept of RBAC, which is a key component of many authorization models, including AD's.
	- RBAC **`allows administrators to assign permissions to users based on their roles within the organization`** rather than assigning permissions to individual users.
	- This approach simplifies the management of permissions and enhances security by ensuring that users have only the access they need to perform their jobs [5](https://www.strongdm.com/what-is/active-directory-authentication).

- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: SSO allows users to log in once and gain access to multiple systems without being prompted to log in again.
	- This feature enhances user experience and security by reducing the number of passwords users need to remember
	- by minimizing the risk of unauthorized access due to weak or reused passwords [5](https://www.strongdm.com/what-is/active-directory-authentication).

- **Accounting**: practices and measures taken to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of financial and accounting data.
	- This includes the protection of sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII), financial records, and intellectual property.
	- Given the critical nature of accounting data, securing it is essential to prevent data breaches, which can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and legal consequences for organizations.

	- **Cybersecurity Measures**: firewalls, encryption, and secure access controls

- **Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)**: it's a networking protocol that provides centralized Authentication, 
	- Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) management for users who connect and use a network service
	- **`manage access to network resources such as Wi-Fi, VPNs, and dial-up connections.`** 
	- client-server model where the client (e.g., a user's device) sends authentication requests to the RADIUS server
	- which then communicates with a database or other back-end systems to verify the user's credentials and determine their access rights.
	- **Accounting**: Be aware that RADIUS also handles accounting
	- **Authentication Process**: Understand the authentication process in RADIUS, which involves the exchange of Access-Request and Access-Accept/Access-Reject messages between the client and the RADIUS server

- **Diameter**: Diameter is primarily used in `telecommunication` networks, including mobile networks like `LTE`, and is designed to be more flexible and scalable than RADIUS.
	- Securing the communication between LTE users and WiMAX users in a 4g and 5 infrastructure 

- **Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+)**:  a protocol developed by Cisco for AAA servers designed to provide a more secure and flexible alternative to RADIUS, addressing some of the limitations of RADIUS
	- Such as its inability to separate authentication and authorization processes, and its reliance on UDP
	- which can be less secure than TCP. TACACS+ uses TCP for transport, which offers more reliability and security than UDP
	- **Comparison with RADIUS**: TACACS+ uses TCP for transport, supports multiple privilege levels, and separates authentication, authorization, and accounting processes, offering more flexibility and security than RADIUS.
		- also encrypts the entire packet payload, providing a more secure communication channel [1](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security-vpn/remote-authentication-dial-user-service-radius/13838-10.html)[2](https://rublon.com/blog/radius-vs-tacacs/).
	- **Use Cases**: Understand that TACACS+ is primarily used for device administration using Access Control Server (ACS) servers
	- **Protocol Features**: support for session multiplexing, allowing multiple services to be handled within a single session
		- **`and encrypts its packet payload`**
