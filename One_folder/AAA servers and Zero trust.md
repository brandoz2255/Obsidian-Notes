- **Zero Trust**: is a Security Concept that assumes no users or devices automatically trusted the entity must prove who they are first. regardless of where they are at. 

- **Deception Technology**: is a strategic approach to confuse or trap the enemy/adversary to mislead attackers such as 

- **Honeypots**: These are decoy systems designed to mimic real systems and attract attackers. They are used to gather information about attackers' methods and to detect and analyze malware.

- **Honeynet**: A larger network of Honeypots 

- **Darknets**: These are portions of a network's IP address space that are set aside and not used by legitimate systems. Any activity directed to these addresses is likely to be malicious, allowing security teams to focus on potential threats.

- **Honeytokens**: These are fake data or credentials that appear to be valuable to attackers. They are placed in systems to lure attackers and help identify their methods and targets. 
	- could also be named breadcrumbs 


**AAA Protocols**: AKA *Authentication* , *Authorization* and *Accounting* which is a security framework that makes sure users  claim who they are and are recorded for their actions ensure they  have right access to information. 


In which 

- **Authentication** is  : the processes of verifying the identity of the user or system
- **Authorization** is making sure that the user is authenticated that that user is allowed to accesses the information or resources 
- **Accounting**: This involves tracking an logging the activates of each user in the system such as login times logout times and actions  done like log analysis
	- to make it easier for auditing and forensics and as mentioned log analysis
