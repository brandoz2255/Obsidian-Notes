### **Examples in Context**

- **Policy, Immediate Action**:
    - "To persuade my audience to go Christmas shopping on Amazon this year."
    - "To persuade my audience that they should vote to abolish University parking fees."
- **Policy, Passive Agreement**:
    - "To persuade my audience that the Federal Government should spend funding on improving the roads."
- **Value**:
    - "To persuade my audience that eating meat is unethical."
- **Fact**:
    - "To persuade my audience that eating meat is unhealthy."


## Where we need to work on 
- **Immediate Action**: Persuades the audience to take action now. (Example: "Vote to abolish University parking fees today.")

- **Passive Agreement**: Persuades the audience to agree that a certain action is desirable, without urging immediate action. (Example: "The Federal Government should spend funding on improving roads.")
