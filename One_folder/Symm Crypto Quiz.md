#### What length encryption key does the Data Encryption Standard use?

- 56 bits
    
    Correct
    
    DES is a symmetric encryption algorithm. It is a block cipher that works on 64-bit blocks using a 56-bit key.


#### Jasmine comes across a file sent out of her organization that she suspects contains proprietary trade secrets but appears to be an innocuous image. What technique might the sender have used to hide information in the image?

- Steganography
    
    Correct
    
    Steganography is the process of hiding information within another file so that it is not visible to the naked eye.


#### What basic cryptographic functions does the AES algorithm use to encrypt plaintext?

- Both substitution and transposition
    
    Correct
    
    AES uses a combination of substitution and transposition functions to achieve strong encryption.

#### How many keys should be used with 3DES to achieve the greatest level of security?

- 3
    
    Correct
    
    When key 1, 2, and 3 are all different, the effective key strength is 112 bits.
