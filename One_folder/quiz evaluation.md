4. evaluate f(0) at the original function as well as f(2) f(3) and f(-1) like we did doo so we don't need to redo that  two global max or  $x =0$ and $x =3$ and min $x = -1$ and $x = 2$ this is where we went wrong! 
6. Question two : critical point  1 and 3.5 and 3 end point 1, 5 min 5 ,1 and local max 3.5 global min 1 ,
