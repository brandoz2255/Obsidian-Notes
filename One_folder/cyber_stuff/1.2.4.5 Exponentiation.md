**Successive squaring** is method in which we can do exponentiation by squaring we do this in a programming language by programming a function to do this for us. 

- We do this using the recursive method by calling the function multiple times for example 

```JS 
function power(x, n) {
   if (n === 0) return 1;
   if (n % 2 === 0) {
       const half = power(x, Math.floor(n / 2));
       return half * half;
   } else {
       return x * power(x, Math.floor(n / 2)) * power(x, Math.floor(n / 2));
   }
}

console.log(power(2, 3)); // Outputs: 8
```

- We could also simply do this in a linear iteration method as well for example 

```JS 
function power(x, n) {
   let result = 1;
   while (n > 0) {
       if (n % 2 === 1) {
           result *= x;
       }
       x *= x;
       n = Math.floor(n / 2);
   }
   return result;
}

console.log(power(2, 3)); // Outputs: 8
```

`%` We have notes on what this operator does but its important to have a reminder on which this does division of two numbers and returns the remainder 

#algorithms #recursive #iterative 

**Recursive Algorithm**: Breaks down a problem in order to solve similar instances of that problem. 

- In other words makes a big problem smaller so that the main problem itself can get solved directly

**Iterative algorithm**: Solves a problem by b repeatedly doing a set of actions until the condition is met. 

- In other words does a list of instructions [expressions] until the `while == condition_met`

The  algorithms are different than the Linear process of the algorithms in which O(n) where the size n input affects the functions Linearly of course this can change depending on the problem 
[[iterative Algorithm]]

# Greatest Common Divisors 
`GCD` is a method to find the greatest common divisors between two integers this is done by dividing the two numbers with no remainder.  '

- However this isn't math and we aren't doing this for mathematical reasoning however this pulls a very important algorithm called *Euclidean algorithm*. 
Example in Python 

```Python
def gcd(a, b):
   if b == 0:
       return a
   else:
       return gcd(b, a % b)
```

It could also be done iterative 

```Python 
def gcd(a, b):
   while b != 0:
       a, b = b, a % b
   return a

```

- For the sake of time I had to do python

**Euclidean Algorithm**: it finds the GCD of two numbers which is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. 

- In other words it is a way to iteratively reduce a problem to a simpler form until a base case is reached. 

Here is an example in Cryptography 

```JS 
function lcs(X, Y, m, n) {
   if (m == 0 || n == 0)
       return "";
   if (X[m - 1] == Y[n - 1])
       return X[m - 1] + lcs(X, Y, m - 1, n - 1);
   else {
       var len1 = lcs(X, Y, m, n - 1);
       var len2 = lcs(X, Y, m - 1, n);
       if (len1 > len2)
           return len1;
       else
           return len2;
   }
}

// Usage:
var X = "AGGTAB";
var Y = "GXTXAYB";
console.log("Length of LCS is " + lcs(X, Y, X.length, Y.length));
```

- Think of this algorithm as both recursive and iterative combined it breaks down a problem until it reaches the condition

**Lam√©'s Theorem**: Its an analysis of the Euclidean algorithm in which it provides a limit number of steps to do the algorithm meaning the time complexity of the algorithm O(n) 

- Meaning that the algorithms running time is in proportional to the size of the input.
