## Object Oriented Programming

- When programming a large and complex program that deals with manually capturing the targets keystrokes we could/should use OOP style of programming
- What it is essentially the idea of making an object in code such we must add the characteristics of this object and each characteristic has a method to define the characteristic and each method has a list of instructions that define the method eventually coming together to make the class and each class makes up the object
- As of right I only know how to do it in Python it is and can be done in C++ as well but doing it in C would be confusing (for now I
- ‚Äôm pretty sure we are using C++)

## Structure

- How it works is essentially taking our code and making into smaller parts and then piecing it together to make a bigger project/program
- Such dividing what each major part of the program does into classes which would effectively teach us ‚ÄúProper programming techniques‚Äù
    - A class is essentially a function for the function which is a storage unit that contains functions
    - Also a Function is a block of code that contains well code in which a function contains variables and statements which the class holds the function that contains those blocks of code
- So how we could structure it is having a class that does each thing/method/task our keylogger should do such as a class for handling the keystrokes , the files, the Hook manager
- That gives us three classes to make a general Keylogger but if we want it to be more advanced or do more than just log keystrokes we could also add more classes that do more tasks  

### Sorry

- There also might be other ways to design this program however the OOP method is the only method of programming that I know so far so if anyone finds another please add it üòÉ
- Sorry if this got confusing i was going just from my head but if you want a better understanding I got you from this source with examples üôÇ
