# AI notes 

Yes, you need to set up SSH on your Arch Linux machine before you can access it remotely from your Windows machine. Here are the steps to set up SSH on Arch Linux:

1. Install the OpenSSH package. OpenSSH provides the SSH client and server tools. You can install it using the pacman package manager:

`sudo pacman -S openssh`

2. Start and enable the SSH daemon:

`sudo systemctl start sshd sudo systemctl enable sshd`

3. Check the status of the SSH service:

`sudo systemctl status sshd`

4. Configure your firewall to allow SSH connections. If you're using UFW, you can do this with the following commands:

`sudo ufw allow ssh sudo ufw reload`

5. Now you should be able to SSH into your Arch Linux machine from your Windows machine using PuTTY. Open PuTTY, enter the IP address of your Arch Linux machine, and click "Open". You'll be asked for your username and password.

Remember, the default port for SSH is 22, so make sure this port is open in your firewall settings. Also, ensure that your Arch Linux machine has a static IP address or use a dynamic DNS service if it doesn't have a static IP address [1](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/OpenSSH).


## To end 
We would stop like

Yes, you can stop the SSH service on your Arch Linux machine when you're done using it by running the following command:

`sudo systemctl stop sshd`

[

This will temporarily disable the SSH service. However, keep in mind that this does not uninstall the SSH software from your system. The next time you start your computer, the SSH service will not automatically start unless you manually start it again with `sudo systemctl start sshd`.

If you want to prevent the SSH service from starting at boot, you can disable it with the following command:

`sudo systemctl disable sshd`

[

](https://www.phind.com/agent?cache=clrlhyrfw000ujy08kodd87sx)

This will prevent the SSH service from starting automatically when your system boots. You can re-enable it at any time with `sudo systemctl enable sshd`.
