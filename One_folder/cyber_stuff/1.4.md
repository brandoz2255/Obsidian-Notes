## Logs

are basically the opposite of a function in which we take $4^4$ we multiply 4, 4 times  in which a log is dividing the base the amount of times the log is 

- $Logs$ are usually always base 10 when not specified 
- $ln$ typically indicates the natural log which is Euler number in the logarithmic equation

### Properties of Log 

1. **`Product Rule:`** logb(xy) = logb(x) + logb(y) - when its multiplying in the base its just adding the two logs together
2. **`Quotient Rule`**: logb(x/y) = logb(x) - logb(y)- when its division in the log its subtracting the two bases in the log form 
3. **`Power Rule`**: logb(x^n) = n * logb(x - when the power of something is within the log 
4. **`Change Of Base Formula`**: = logb(x) = loga(x)/loga(b) - where a is the base 10 ten. 

### Domain and Range 

**Domain**: The Domain of x is always greater than 0 x > 0 it depends on all the positive real numbers. within the graph. 

**Range**: The ranges depends ont eh base b if b is grater than 1 than the range is all real numbers but if 0 < b < 1 the range is restricted to negative real numbers. 

#### Parent 

$$y = logb(x)$$

- base b 
- parent function
