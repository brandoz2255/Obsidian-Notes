1. **Python Packages:** Any Python packages or modules that your project depends on should be placed in the `lib` directory. These can include libraries for tasks such as web scraping, data manipulation, machine learning, or any other functionality that your project requires.
    
2. **JavaScript Libraries:** If your project involves front-end development using frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js, you may include JavaScript libraries or frameworks in the `lib` directory. These libraries can provide additional functionality, UI components, or utilities for your web application.
    
3. **CSS Frameworks:** Similarly, if your project requires styling or design elements, you may include CSS frameworks or libraries in the `lib` directory. These frameworks can help standardize the appearance and layout of your web pages and streamline the development process.
    
4. **Other Resources:** Any other resources or files that your project depends on but are not part of the core codebase can also be included in the `lib` directory. This could include fonts, icons, images, or configuration files used by your project.


Libraries we need 

**Python Libraries:**

1. OpenCV: Essential for computer vision tasks like image processing, gesture recognition, and facial detection.
2. PyAutoGUI: Useful for simulating mouse and keyboard input, which could be handy for controlling the GUI based on gestures.
3. Numpy: A fundamental library for numerical computing, often used alongside OpenCV for array manipulation and mathematical operations.

**JavaScript Libraries:**

1. Electron: As the framework for building desktop applications with web technologies.
2. Tensorflow.js: While primarily used for machine learning in the browser, it could be useful for implementing simple computer vision tasks on the frontend.
3. Three.js: A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics, which could add a futuristic touch to your Electron app's interface.

**CSS Framework:**

1. Cyberpunk CSS: A CSS framework specifically designed to give websites and applications a cyberpunk aesthetic. It offers styles inspired by cyberpunk themes, including neon colors, futuristic typography, and glitch effects.
