1. **Network Scanner (Python):**
    
    - Python is excellent for networking tasks. Use libraries like Scapy to craft a robust network scanner. It can identify devices, open ports, and potential vulnerabilities within a network.
2. **Web Application Firewall (Node.js):**
    
    - Node.js is perfect for building real-time applications. Create a Web Application Firewall using the event-driven nature of Node.js. You can employ frameworks like Express for handling HTTP requests and responses.
3. **Malware Analysis Tool (C++):**
    
    - Leveraging the efficiency of C++, build a Malware Analysis Tool. C++ provides low-level control, crucial for dissecting and analyzing malicious code. You might want to explore disassembling techniques and memory forensics.

Absolutely, Dulce! It's great that you want to explore security tool development in areas you're familiar with. Here are a few ideas for security tools you could explore using your current skills:

1. **JavaScript-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**
    
    - Develop a lightweight IDS using JavaScript for web-based environments.
    - Implement rules for detecting suspicious activities in web logs.
    - Utilize Node.js for server-side scripting.
2. **Python Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    
    - Create a WAF in Python to protect web applications from common security threats.
    - Focus on features like input validation, SQL injection prevention, and cross-site scripting (XSS) protection.
3. **C++ Malware Analysis Tool:**
    
    - Build a tool in C++ for analyzing and dissecting malware.
    - Implement features for static and dynamic analysis of malicious code.
4. **HTML/CSS-based Phishing Awareness Simulator:**
    
    - Develop a web-based tool using HTML/CSS to simulate phishing attacks.
    - Provide a platform for users to practice identifying phishing attempts.
5. **Python Network Scanner with GUI:**
    
    - Create a network scanner tool in Python with a graphical user interface.
    - Enable users to scan their local network for connected devices and potential vulnerabilities.

Remember, these are just starting points, and you can expand or modify them based on your interests and research goals. Also, feel free to incorporate elements of your own creativity and innovation into the projects. Â¡Buena suerte, Dulce!
