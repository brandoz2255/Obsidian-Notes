The **constant rate of change** of one quantity relates  to the other quantity when it exits like if any change happens in one quantity the same is applied to the other.

$${\triangle}w=8.34 * {\triangle}v$$


This instance does not mean that it is 8.34 times the volume of water it is simply stating that the change of weight in the bath is always 8.34 times as large as the change in volume! 

For example if we add 13 gallons od water to the bath tub we get 13 gallons times the 8.34 since the change of weigh in the bath tub is always the change in volume times 8.34 


$${\triangle}w = 8.34 * {\triangle}v = 8.34 {\times} 13 = 108.42,pounds $$



Se here when we change one value such as the volume of water it also changes the other value weight of the bath tub 

- However we must remember that the change in w and v is different that the actual valves of w and v 

We could drain the bathtub as in this example

The formula we used for the contant rate of change 

![[Screenshot from 2023-12-05 13-32-46.png]]

$$m={\frac{{\triangle}y}{{\triangle}x}} = {\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}}$$


m = the constant rate of change formula for the constant rate of change when we dont have the change of y and the change of x
