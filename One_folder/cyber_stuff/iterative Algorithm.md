**Iterative algorithm**: Solves a problem by b repreatdly doing a set of actions until the condition is met. 

- In other words does a list of instructions [expressions] until the `while == condition_met`

Before the 200 BCE, the concept of iterative algorithms can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Babylonians and Egyptians. These early civilizations developed mathematical formulas and algorithms to solve complex problems.

The Babylonians, for instance, are credited with creating one of the oldest known algorithms, dating back to around 1800-1600 BC. These algorithms, found on a set of Babylonian clay tablets, were general procedures for solving a variety of problems, not just specific individual problems [1](https://interestingengineering.com/lists/15-of-the-most-important-algorithms-that-helped-define-mathematics-computing-and-physics).

Similarly, the ancient Egyptians developed algorithms for arithmetic dating back to the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus around 1550 BC [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm).
