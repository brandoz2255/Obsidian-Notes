# Functions Abstractions 
[[abstractions]] defndition in case we need it 

basically making a function as simple to look at as possible while still maintaining the same quality of process as other functions. Simplifying and making it easier to read for the Computer and the human. 

- Keep in mind there are multiple ways to write out a function each with the same level of quantity the goal should be as to what is easier to read for a programmer 

Complicated but abstracted to a single function 
```JS 
function sumOfEvenNumbers(arr) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] % 2 === 0) {
            sum += arr[i];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const result = sumOfEvenNumbers(numbers);
console.log(result);  // Output: 30

```

Less complicated but contains three more functions 
```JS
function sumOfEvenNumbers(arr) {
    return arr.filter(isEven).reduce(add, 0);
}

function isEven(num) {
    return num % 2 === 0;
}

function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const result = sumOfEvenNumbers(numbers);
console.log(result);  // Output: 30
```

**black box** is something to keep in mind in programming it *refers to the idea* that the user of our *program* doesn't need to know how our function works in order to use it

- term `black box` can be best defined as simply the programs observable behavior on what it does rather than how it does it
- Focusing on `abstraction` creates a sense of `black box` to a user rather than forcing a user or a programmer to understand every little thing.  only focused on input and output 

```JS
// Black box function abstraction
function calculateArea(radius) {
    // Internal details are hidden from the user
    const pi = 3.14;
    const area = pi * radius * radius;
    return area;
}

// Users only need to know the inputs and outputs
const radius = 5;
const result = calculateArea(radius);

// Users don't need to know how the function works internally
console.log(result);  // Output: 78.5

```
## Local Names 

Essentially the function of a program should be affected by the algorithm it was programmed in not the parameters of a function it should not have any affect at all. 

```Python 
# Function that computes the sum of elements in a list
def sum_elements(data):
    total = 0
    for element in data:
        total += element
    return total

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = sum_elements(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: 15

```
- Here is a python example so we can read it well 

```JS 
// Function to find the maximum value in an array
function findMaxValue(arr) {
    let max = arr[0]; // Assume the first element is the maximum
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > max) {
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return max;
}

// Example usage
const numbers = [8, 2, 14, 6, 10];
const result = findMaxValue(numbers);
console.log(result); // Output: 14

```

- Here is the same idea in JS 

## Internal Declarations and Block structure 
This is simple but the book over complicates it basically in order for a function to run properly it must be nested in a proper block structure that holds the code.

- block structure  isn't the function however the indention of a expression such as a while loop or for loop and block structure is the same as in functions

- In `python` its the indention we know and love to make easier to read however in most languages such as JS and C++ its within `{}` brackets that define block structure 
```Python 
if True:
    # This code is part of the block controlled by the 'if' statement
    print("Inside the 'if' block")

# Code outside the 'if' block
print("Outside the 'if' block")

```

```JS
if (true) {
    // This code is part of the block controlled by the 'if' statement
    console.log("Inside the 'if' block");
}

// Code outside the 'if' block
console.log("Outside the 'if' block");

```

Internal declaration is the declaration of a variable withing a block structure 

- block structures help is break down a program into a more manageable tractable pieces first introduced in the Algol 60 programming language
