In most of our projects we need to make a way to organize the shit for out code because it gets annoying when we get lost in the file 


- great way to orgranize everything contain it in a docker container then it would have all the dependencies within the git file and such so a docker is needed here is more info on that [[docker]]

- have a seperate file/module that handles a specific task for this porject one that handles data one for generation one for communication etc
