Code obsfucation is code that has hidden meaning that means code that is hard af to read but does something malicous to our system.  

- the HTB modules use HTML websites with JS code to show that some sites have malicious code within their site 

example of code obsfucation 

```JS 
eval(function (p, a, c, k, e, d) { e = function (c) { '...SNIP... |true|function'.split('|'), 0, {}))

```

- what does it do we need to find out type shit 
- The module describes what sites do with CSS and HTML and JavaScript however we have been studying this already in the JS notes so we connected it here 
- The web dev notes to our Blue team notes covering malicious sites
