# Zettle Note method
[[The famous note taking method]]
[source](https://obsidian.rocks/getting-started-with-zettelkasten-in-obsidian/)
- This note taking method completely derives off this german researcher who was essentially responsible for `many books` 
	- He wrote alot books in short amount of time as well as articles 
- He named it the slipbox method but the German word for slipbox `Zettlekasten` 

## Fleeting Notes
- This note taking process consists of three steps the first step is the Fleeting Notes 
Essentially the ==Fleeting Notes== in the Niklas Luhmann era he would essentially write all the reminders on the topic he was reading in note cards and store them in the `slip-box` which is why it was called the `Zettlekasten`

## Permanent Notes
- This comes off directly of the Fleeting notes step in which Luhmann would read a subject find something interesting about it and take reminder notes on the subject so that he could write more about in this step 
- we Take the Fleeting notes we made on the subject and turn them into fully fledge Notes like this note page for example 

==The process in order to really work has to come off purely from the Fleeting notes== we made on the subject otherwise it would just be making more fleeting notes on the article,video or lecture we are taking the notes on ineffective

- Then what makes this process more special is the easy to read part we must also focus on making these notes easy to read without context on the subject essentially making our notes ==golden== with the process of coming back when the subject is a little fuzzy in our memories 

- Then the third step consists of `Rince and repeating` the first two steps

## Literature Notes

This comes off purely from our `mentors` head in which he does `his own research` on the `subject `he just took fleet and permanent notes on but just repeats the process on another source

-  The key thing to note is that the source of course has to be from a trusted site you don't want to have useless information on a subject that has misinformation written all over it this just makes our notes ineffective and wastes our time 
	- `All we need to do is just repeat our steps read or watch the subject from another trusted source to get more information on the subject or get as much as we can and or get another perspective on it `
	- We take fleeting notes on the subject to keep reminders on what we are studying for the permanent step 
	- Then we make the permanent notes off the fleeting notes and our knowledge on the subject 
- This is the cool part of this step essentially we take the two permanent notes we just made and combine them into one this comes from our head but if this doesn't work out for us we could use our `mentors method instead which is kinda the same but he just makes another permanent notes but purely off of his head after these two permanent notes have just been made `
- But our method will be kinda be the same essentially furthering our itneractive notes method by looking over the two permanent notes we made and writing a whole new permanent note [Literature Notes] but based purely off of my knowledge on it and the two notes I have just made on the subject Ive studied 

# Conclusion 

This note taking method takes note taking to a whole new level essentially writing useless notes that are just reminders on what I was doing and coming back to them after like a week or a month makes them essentially useless 
- Then turning them into a more fully fledge note with the aim of having the most detailed information on the subject in case my memory is so bad I come back to this and remember everything like if i just watched the subject 
- With the focus on helping myself remember the subject with zero context to it 
Then doing my own research on the subject and just repeating the `Fleeting and Permanent` process of my notes on the trusted source that talks about the same subject to further my  knowledge on the subject `However this also makes it excelent for studying` in which we go over our notes and the research we made on that subject and then combining the information on those two notes into a seperate note completely advancing our knowledge on the subject



- Christian actually uses it by doing fleeting first for source 1 then fleeting for source 2 and jots it down into literature notes then moves it into the permanent notes permanents are the last one 
- fleet , literature , permanent 
- literature has the most of what is less from you and more form word for of the source the fleet is your concept and reminders on the subject the permanent is of course how we have researched it
