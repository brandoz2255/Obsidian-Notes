Same **function** definition in all of math a function is when an input gives out at least or exactly one output

- in discrete math we call the output of the function an **`image`** of the input 
-  **Domain** is also important its the set of all inputs of the graph 
- **Co-domain** aka range is the set of all outputs

d- f : x -> y is how you describe the function with the name f domain x to co-domain y 


example: 
- $f : N â†’ N$ is defined defined by $f (x) = x^2 + 3$  #research 

**Range**: The range on the other is all the output values that the function can produce  aka dependent variables 

$$Range: ( B = \{ y \in \mathbb{R} \mid y \geq 0 \} )$$

rule of thumb is that there is exactly one input for each output 

### How is the co-domain different than range 
**Co-domain**: is the set that contains all possible outputs that a function can produce.  

- can be larger than the range itself since it includes all posssible values that the function can take 
- Independent to the actual input values 

- **Range**:
    - The range is the set of actual output values that a function produces when all input values in the domain are processed. It is a subset of the codomain, meaning it includes only those values that the function actually produces [1](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3317941/what-is-the-difference-between-codomain-and-range)[4](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-codomain-and-range).
    - The range depends on the function and the specific inputs given to it; it cannot include values that the function does not produce [1](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3317941/what-is-the-difference-between-codomain-and-range)[4](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-codomain-and-range).
    - The range can be more specific than the codomain because it reflects the actual behavior of the function with the given inputs [1](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3317941/what-is-the-difference-between-codomain-and-range)[4](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-codomain-and-range).
### What is a function and what is not a function in discrete 
- What makes a function is the element of each set knows the domain is exactly one of the element of another set known as the co-domain. 
	- each element in the domain is paired with exactly one element in the co-domain
	- A function is we defined when the input in the domain has a clear consistent output co-domain.

- rule of four same in calc and discrete : can explain/be more than that in discrete 
The "rule of four" in discrete math refers to the four properties that distinguish functions from mere relations:

1. **Definiteness**: Each input (element of the domain) is associated with exactly one output (element of the codomain). This means that there is no ambiguity in the assignment of outputs to inputs [1](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-functions.html)[2](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi2/sec_intro-functions.html).
    
2. **Well-definedness**: For every input from the domain, there is a corresponding output in the codomain. No input can be left without an output, and no output can be produced without an input [1](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-functions.html)[2](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi2/sec_intro-functions.html).
    
3. **Domain**: The domain is the set of all possible inputs that the function can accept. It is the collection of all values that can be plugged into the function [1](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-functions.html)[2](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi2/sec_intro-functions.html).
    
4. **Codomain**: The codomain is the set of all possible outputs that the function can produce. It is the collection of all values that the function can return. The codomain may include elements that are not actually produced by the function when applied to its domain [1](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-functions.html)[2](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi2/sec_intro-functions.html).


- notation:: table of values of a function in discrete 

# Notation table of values
In Discrete math a table is a way to represent the function via table especially when we are dealing with smaller domains and co-domains

- lists the tables of inputs and outputs 
```markdown
Input | Output
------+-------
   0   |   3
   1   |   3
   2   |   2
   3   |   4
   4   |   1

```


- matrix's. 
In Discrete math a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers in rows and columns. each individual number is refereed to an element. 

example of matrix 
```math
f(n) =  
(1  2  3  4
4  1  3  4
)

```

$$f(n) =  
(1\space  2\space  3\space  4\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space
4\space  1\space  3\space  4\space
)
$$

where the inputs on the left are what is supposed to be on top and the right inputs is what is supposed to be on the bottom 

- **Elementary Matrices**: These are matrices that can be derived from the identity matrix through specific operations like swapping rows or columns, multiplying a row or column by a scalar, or adding multiples of one row or column to another [1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/elementary-matrices-discrete-mathematics/#:~:text=A%20matrix%20is%20a%20collection,3*3%20%3D%209)).
    
- **Identity Matrix**: An identity matrix is a special kind of square matrix (m x m) where all the elements of the main diagonal are ones, and all other elements are zeroes [1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/elementary-matrices-discrete-mathematics/#:~:text=A%20matrix%20is%20a%20collection,3*3%20%3D%209)).
    

- **Row and Column Operations**: Elementary row operations involve swapping two rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar, or adding a multiple of one row to another. Similarly, elementary column operations involve swapping two columns, multiplying a column by a non-zero scalar, or adding a multiple of one column to another [1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/elementary-matrices-discrete-mathematics/#:~:text=A%20matrix%20is%20a%20collection,3*3%20%3D%209)).

- **Non-Singularity**: The inverse of an elementary matrix is also an elementary matrix, and if a square matrix can be expressed as the product of elementary matrices, it is invertible [1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/elementary-matrices-discrete-mathematics/#:~:text=A%20matrix%20is%20a%20collection,3*3%20%3D%209)).

- **Matrix Equality**: Two matrices are considered equal if they have the same dimensions and each corresponding element is equal [2](https://www.javatpoint.com/matrix-in-discrete-mathematics)[3](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~pkirby/mad2104/SlideShow/s5_4.pdf)[4](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ReviewICS141/morea/linear-algebra/Matrices-QA.pdf).

- **Types of Matrices**: There are various types of matrices including row matrices, column matrices, square matrices, identity matrices, zero matrices, and others. Each type has specific characteristics or properties that define it [5](https://www.javatpoint.com/type-of-matrices-in-discrete-mathematics).


- closed formulas 
- Recursive functions/ recursively defined functions 
- Surjections, Injections, and Bijections




- say the function is one-to-one.  :: what does this mean ?? 
- injective vs surjective 
## Injective vs Surjective

- **`Surjective Function`**  (known as `onto`) works as if every element in the `codomain` is the image of at least one element from the `domain` 
	- all elements in  the domain are covered by the function 

- **`Injective Function`** (aka `one-to-one`) if different elements in the `domain` always produce different images in the `co-domain` 
	- meaning that no two different elements in the `domain` map to the same in the `codomain` 

- image vs inverse image
