[[Constant Rate of change (2.3 and 2.4)]]

[[Average speed (2.5)]]

[[Absolute Value(2.7)]] easy do it tmr on saturday but when we do it get locked in ofc 

[[Function relations and function Domain (3.1 - 3.4) ]]simple not eady we need to be locked in 

[[Inverse Functions (3.6)]]


## Module 4 important 

percent change and percentages : Important shit to learn and memorize 

Linear and exponential behavior : same importance

growth factors and percent change :  defnintely 

partial and n unit growth factors initial values and 1 unit growth as well 

n unit growth and decay factors 

Logs the opposite of a exponential function

## Module 5 quadratic functions 

Rate of change and concavity co varying relationships 

Ploynomial functions 

Quadratic functions 

end bahavior for poly and monomials 

roots and end behavor of poly extended 


## Rationals functions 

Finding the VA the HA and the Domain graphing and the theory behind it and then put to real situation 

## Trigonometry

We do more than what we learned in math 3 in which for now we only need to know sin and cosine how they work answer in the calc needs to be in radians unit cirlce and alngles 

Then we do the triangles such as the right triangles and normal triangles 


## Module 8
