### My Personal Notes Duhh
- [[pwd]]: Stands for print working directory which shows you where you are in the CLI which means command line interface in case you forget. 
- **CD:** Means Change Directory and what it does is it do changes your directory in the CLI (**CD ..** to move up once **CD ../..** to move up twice and so on and so on)
- **Ls:** means list which is my favorite command 
- cand be used with Ls -l and with Ls -La
- When in CLI use -- for [full words] and - [for just single words]
- **CAT** opens files you can also use [CAT ./]
#### MAN: 
- Which means Manuel This one is highlighted since it is the biggest thing that will help in Linux
