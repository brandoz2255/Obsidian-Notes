- Once we have information on our target we can use the Domain Name System which is an exellent place to look for this kind of information.

## What is DNS
- The DNS is the internets phone book which is of course descirbed by our original IT teacher
- Domains such as  hackthebox.com and inlanefreight.com allow people to access content on the iternet 
- The internet protocol which we know as the IP addresses are used to communicate between web browsers
- DNS converts domain names to IP addresses allowing browsers to access resources on the internet
- Each Internet connected device has a unique IP address that other machines use to locate it
- A DNS server minimizes the need for peoplee to learn the IP address lik `184.17.42.72` or of course a mire sophisticated modern alpanumeric IP address like` 2606:4700::6811:2b48 `in IPv6
- When a user types www.facebook.com into their web browser a translation must occur between what the user types and the IP address required to reach the facebook page
- The advantages of using DNS are the usage of allowing the sue of numbers to identify hosts
	- It allows names to be used instead of numbers to identify hosts.
	- It is a lot easier to remember a name than it is to recall a number.
	- By merely retargeting a name to the new numeric address, a server can change numeric addresses without having to notify everyone on the Internet.
	- A single name might refer to several hosts splitting the workload between different servers.
- within the strucure of the DNS system there is heiracrhcy of names the systems  version of the root is unamed 
-  the TLD is known as the top level domain which is the last portion hosted on a name server
- like for example www.facebook.com the TLD server is the [com]
- Most of the TLDS are run run by the country or delegated specifically;ly towards the country they get these codes from the [ISO_table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes)
-  The ones managed by the united nations agency is called ccTLDs which is country code 
- the generic ones are called gTLDs these ones arent assigned to a spefic country code its jsut generic 
- manager who manage the TDLs have to configure  the Second Level Domain Names (SLDs) anf other lower hierarchy domains

|---|---|
|`Resource Record`|A domain name, usually a fully qualified domain name, is the first part of a Resource Record. If you don't use a fully qualified domain name, the zone's name where the record is located will be appended to the end of the name.|
|`TTL`|In seconds, the Time-To-Live (`TTL`) defaults to the minimum value specified in the SOA record.|
|`Record Class`|Internet, Hesiod, or Chaos|
|`Start Of Authority` (`SOA`)|It should be first in a zone file because it indicates the start of a zone. Each zone can only have one `SOA` record, and additionally, it contains the zone's values, such as a serial number and multiple expiration timeouts.|
|`Name Servers` (`NS`)|The distributed database is bound together by `NS` Records. They are in charge of a zone's authoritative name server and the authority for a child zone to a name server.|
|`IPv4 Addresses` (`A`)|The A record is only a mapping between a hostname and an IP address. 'Forward' zones are those with `A` records.|
|`Pointer` (`PTR`)|The PTR record is a mapping between an IP address and a hostname. 'Reverse' zones are those that have `PTR` records.|
|`Canonical Name` (`CNAME`)|An alias hostname is mapped to an `A` record hostname using the `CNAME` record.|
|`Mail Exchange` (`MX`)|The `MX` record identifies a host that will accept emails for a specific host. A priority value has been assigned to the specified host. Multiple MX records can exist on the same host, and a prioritized list is made consisting of the records for a specific host.|

# Nslookup and DIG
- During a pent test we need to first identify what infrastructure is public ally available 
- we can find out using many diff types of  requests 
- one such like nslookup 
- with this CLI tool we can look up differnt types of DNS requests  and look at other dmain name servers and ask them fro info onm thje hosts and other domains 
- tool has two modes itneract and non interact 

example 
```shell-session
00818@htb[/htb]$ export TARGET="facebook.com"
00818@htb[/htb]$ nslookup $TARGET

Server:		1.1.1.1
Address:	1.1.1.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	facebook.com
Address: 31.13.92.36
Name:	facebook.com
Address: 2a03:2880:f11c:8083:face:b00c:0:25de
```

- with DIG we can speficy  the name of the IP along with the DNS DIG allows for moore info on that can be improtant 
```shell-session
00818@htb[/htb]$ dig facebook.com @1.1.1.1

; <<>> DiG 9.16.1-Ubuntu <<>> facebook.com @1.1.1.1

Ok so much examples on this [HTB](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/144/section/1251) page reference it for more info 
essentially we can use nslookup to get information from teh DNS that are public and our company doen't want to be public DIG is to get more information that can be easily accesible 

- using the prevous commands we have gotten information on A NS NX CNAME 
- however each organization may not have the IP of their own they could  belong to the ISP 
if the organization we are pentesting has therioo own hosting providers we can use whois command

```shell-session
00818@htb[/htb]$ export TARGET="facebook.com"
00818@htb[/htb]$ nslookup $TARGET
