**How to Remember It:** 
- To remember the runtime stack, think about a pile of books. 
- Each book represents a function call. When you add a new book, you're making a new function call.
- When you take a book off the pile, you're returning from a function. 
- Just like you can't start a new chapter (function) without finishing the last, you can't just go to a new function without returning from the current one.
- In C++, you have to be careful not to "over-stack" your plates or books, which is like causing a stack overflow by having too many function calls.

```C++
#include <iostream>

// Function2 is called by Function1
void Function2(int x) {
    int y = x * 2;
    std::cout << "Function2: x = " << x << ", y = " << y << std::endl;
    // Function2 returns to Function1 after this point
}

// Function1 is called by main
void Function1(int a) {
    int b = a + 1;
    std::cout << "Function1: a = " << a << ", b = " << b << std::endl;
    Function2(b); // Calls Function2
    // Function1 returns to main after this point
}

// Main function, the entry point of the program
int main() {
    int value = 5;
    std::cout << "main: value = " << value << std::endl;
    Function1(value); // Calls Function1
    // Program ends after main returns
    return 0;
}

```

Explanation:  

1. **`main()` is Called:** The stack starts with the `main()` frame.
    
2. **`Function1()` is Called by `main()`:** `Function1()` is added on top of the `main()` frame in the stack.
    
3. **`Function2()` is Called by `Function1()`:** `Function2()` is added on top of `Function1()`.
    
4. **`Function2()` Finishes Execution:** After `Function2()` finishes, its frame (the top "book") is removed, leaving `Function1()`'s frame on top.
    
5. **`Function1()` Finishes Execution:** Once `Function1()` is done, its frame is removed, and we're back to the `main()` frame.
    
6. **`main()` Reaches the End:** Finally, `main()` finishes, and its frame is removed, emptying the stack.
