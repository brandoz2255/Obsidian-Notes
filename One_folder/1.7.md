- **`Continuity`**: in math and in calculus the idea of continuity is the idea that a graph continues without bounds and has no limits 

This is where the idea of limits come into fruition in calculus when we are dealing with graphs that are no longer continous they are discrete 

- Limits: its when you look at a graph when aproaches closer and closer to a certain pooint but never getting there 
	- by  definition its where f(x) as x approaches value c is the value that f(x) gets closer and closer to c. used to define continuity, derivatives, and integral

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L
$$

- as we see here as s approachess c f(x)  reaches its limit if it exists 
	- L is the point when s is as close as it can get to c but x cannot equal c

With this in mind we can define a function as continous in which x equals C  and f is defined at x = c we then write 

$$\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$$ 
- This is when a function is continuous 
	- In other words, f(x) is as close as we want to f(c) provided x is close enough to c. The function is continuous on an interval [a, b] if it is continuous at every point in the interval.

## Find the limit algebraically

Given the function $f(x) = x^2$, we want to find the limit as $x$ approaches $2$.

$$\lim_{x \to  2} f(x) = f(2) =  2^2 =  4 $$

2. **Find the limit by factoring**: If you have a rational function and you plug in the `x` value and get `0` in the numerator and denominator, factor the numerator to cancel out terms.

Given the function $f(x) = (x^2 -  4) / (x -  2)$, we want to find the limit as `x` approaches `2`.

First, factor the numerator:
$$x^2 -  4 = (x -  2)(x +  2)$$


So the function becomes:
$$f(x) = \frac{(x -  2)(x +  2)}{x -  2}$$

The $(x -  2)$ terms cancel out, and we're left with:
$$f(x) = x +  2 $$

Now, we can plug in 2:
$$\lim_{x \to  2} f(x) =  2 +  2 =  4$$

in a rational you simplify it as much as possible and plug in c then you get your  limit 
- you can also  do this in beginning but you get a maybe answer rather than an on point answer 

**Intermediate Value Theorem**:  suggest if we have a closed interval in $f(x)$ we can pick any number between $f(a)$ andd $f(b)$ then there exist one number $c$ in the inter val [a,b] such that $f(c)$ is equal to the chosen number. 


### Piecewise Functions

**Piecewise Functions** : its a function that has two parts to the functions basically to solve them we got to combine the two parts into and plug in the values we know and find the missing values we don't. 

- Split up into different parts for the specified range this goes in conjunction with limits since it provides discrete math

Here how it looks like in python 
```Python
def g(t):
    if t <= 5:
        return t + 5/4
    else:
        return (5/4) * t

# Test the function with some values
print("g(3) =", g(3))
print("g(6) =", g(6))
```

- How we would've solved this is that we need to find where 5/4 is like lets we don't know the value of 5/4 and its just k 
	- then we combine the two parts of the function with our given value 5 and solve for k then we get $5/4$
