**Strong encryption**: poses a significant challenge towards law enforcement and government agencies since it prevents them from accessing critical information during investigation. 

#### Key Escrow and Government Access

- **Key Escrow**: A technology that allows government agencies to access encryption keys, provided that they have the court order to do so. 
	- This concept emerged when the government proposed the **Clipper Chip**
	- This chip was designed to allow a backdoor access on encryption while also performing the encryption
- **Controversy**:
	- The proposal of the Clipper Chip sparked controversy 
	- Which united the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), RSA and other security firms to campaign against it. 
	- The Clipper Chip also had numerous flaws, leading to the rejection by the broader tech community

Despite the rejection of the Clipper Chip, Government Agencies and other Law enforcement are still trying to find ways to give a backdoor on encryption.  

- One such notable example is the FBI's demand for Apple to unlock a criminals phone during investigation which resulted in  Apples refusal

	- **Departing Employees**: When an important user leaves an organization, and access to their files is needed.
- **Windows Encrypting File System**(*EFS*):
	- An example of a system that uses recovery agents
	- the recovery agent has a master key providing  global access to all data within that organization. in order that the organization can access the data when needed
