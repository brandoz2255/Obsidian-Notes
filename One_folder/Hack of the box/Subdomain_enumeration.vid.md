# Sublister 
Since this is of course the outside resource of our subject and it is a short video since the subject of passive enumeration is short subject we are gonna look at a tool that can do this for us automatically called sublist3r 

- essentially this tool uses OSINT and uses all th search engines it has access to go through the domain you have imputed and essentailly locate all the subdomains it can and puts them into a list 
- Then you can open the lsit by going to the directory and open it  as a usual file

-  this is the installation process for the tool then we run it by ./ the name of of the module [[CSE/Functions part  two]] to run the program 
- However install the correct one for our python interpreter

- This is how we run the program and we can use the MAN pages with the man pages especially since this program was designed to be helpful
