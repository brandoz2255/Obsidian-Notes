- Within the preparation stage we must have a plan in case of the an incident that happens within the organizations
- Such protecting agaisnt the IT security incidents by implementing protective measures
- Such measures include endpoint and server hardening, active directory tiering, multi-factor authentication, privileged access management, and so on and so forth.

## Pre-requisites of prep
- we need to make sure that we have 
	-  Skilled incident handling team members (incident handling team members can be outsourced, but a basic capability and understanding of incident handling are necessary in-house regardless)
	- Trained workforce (as much as possible, through security awareness activities or other means of training)
	- Clear policies and documentation
	- Tools (software and hardware)


### Policies 
- We need to have policies on contact information of the roles of incident reports and the IT support 
- Incident response policy, plan, and procedures
- Incident information sharing policy and procedures
- Baselines of systems and networks, out of a golden image and a clean state environment
- Network diagrams
- Organization-wide asset management database
- User accounts with excessive privileges that can be used on-demand by the team when necessary (also to business-critical systems, which are handled with the skills needed to administer that specific system). These user accounts are normally enabled when an incident is confirmed during the initial investigation and then disabled once it is over. A mandatory password reset is also performed when disabling the users.
- Ability to acquire hardware, software, or an external resource without a complete procurement process (urgent purchase of up to a certain amount). The last thing you need during an incident is to wait for weeks for the approval of a $500 tool.
- Forensic/Investigative cheat sheets

Some cases of a data breach can handled quick and efficient without outside of the organization getting involved However if the attack is that bad the police does need to get notified in certain time frame. '

- Discussing with the legal is the how we can over come this issue and step

### Documentation 
- Having documentation is vital in any incident report such as the overall description of what happended and how it couldve been prevented We need to remain calm in this step and remember
- That we need to answer a who what where why and how for the incident report

### Tools
- The tools we need to perform the Job but we are not limited to 
	- - Additional laptop or a forensic workstation for each incident handling team member to preserve disk images and log files, perform data analysis, and investigate without any restrictions (we know malware will be tested here, so tools such as antivirus should be disabled). These devices should be handled appropriately and not in a way that introduces risks to the organization.
	- Digital forensic image acquisition and analysis tools
	- Memory capture and analysis tools
	- Live response capture and analysis
	- Log analysis tools
	- Network capture and analysis tools
	- Network cables and switches
	- Write blockers
	- Hard drives for forensic imaging
	- Power cables
	- Screwdrivers, tweezers, and other relevant tools to repair or disassemble hardware devices if needed
	- Indicator of Compromise (IOC) creator and the ability to search for IOCs across the organization
	- Chain of custody forms
	- Encryption software
	- Ticket tracking system
	- Secure facility for storage and investigation
	- Incident handling system independent of your organization's infrastructure

Having all these tools ready is called a jump bag without this would tak days or weeks 
	-  Always have these tools ready in a grab n go style

- Always have the mindest that all of the data is compromised and that we need to secure every documentation so we need to keep this information separate from the Organizations infrastructure.
