The CLI in the MacOS is very similar towards most linux systems this is beacause Darwin that the MacOS Kernel is based off of is derived from the Original Unix Kernel which why many of the same commands go in par with Linux 

- Which Linux is also a kernel that is derived off of the Unix kernel 
- The Linux kernel was based off of the Minix Kernel which was designed with the prupose to be the Open source alternative towards the Unix Kernel 
- However to avoid Copyright issues they used theier own code source which is why Linux exists which is just continueing the philosophy of Minix 

So in conclusion the only thing we would struggle with is the GUI Which actually is very similar towards the Iphone UI since the IOS is derived off of the Darwin kernel its jsut a more mobile version of the MacOS so many of the GUI systems are the same as the Iphone
