`DOS`: Denial of service the act in which the attacker essentially just floods the targeted system with so much traffic rendering it completely useless meaning no one can access the site and making it difficult for users to get resources. 

- This goes in par with the `DDOS`: Distributed Denial of Service  attack which I have been warned about which essentially is the same thing on a larger scale in which attacking multiple systems at once 

## How to prevent 

- There are multiple methods in which we must do to prevent a DDOS and DOS attack there are so much methods we must implement as much as we can and gather information on each topic this would be the main hub on each method 
- A damn good firewall: One of these methods is of course setting up a really good firewall one that detects and prevents traffic and that filters out traffic
- Using tools to monitor traffic: Im guessing wireshark is one of the tools add more info later 
- Rate Limiting is big: add more info 

## How to Respond 

[[guide]] 
- **Tracing the perpetrator**: The first thing we must remember that the attackers machine is a physical entity located somewhere so we must locate the source of the attack. 
- Containment: This is essentially just disconnecting the main device away from the targeted area in which we quarantine the healthy away from the infected area that the attacker attacked.
