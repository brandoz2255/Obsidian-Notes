`IH` aka known as Incident Handling is an important part of the Cyber-securities defense system. This is the process of protective measures that try to prevent or lower the amount of security incidents or incident handling in general. 
- Most companies on there own have their own systems to handle `IH` but some organizations rely on Third party providers. 

# Terms
In the world of security we need to some terms first off in oerder to define a security issue or report incidents 

**Event**: An is an action that occurred over the internet 
- A user sending an email
- A user using the mouse 
- A Firewall connection 

**Incident**: This is an event that has a negative consequence for example is a system crash or unauthorized users accessing data *There is no single definition but relates to*
- Data theft 
- funds Theft 
- Unauthorized access to data 
- Installation and usage of malware and remote access tools 

`Incident handling is a clearly defined set of procedures to manage and respond to security incidents in a computer or network environment.`

**Key thing to note**: An incident isn't something that is always related to intrusion attacks 
- can be related to malicious insiders
- availability issues 
- Loss of intellectual property

A good incident handling plan has to cover all types of incidents in order to provide measures in order to:
- identify 
- contain 
- eradicate 
- recover

We need to know this in order to restore the systems of our organizations quick and efficiently as possible. 

## Incident handling
- The process of incidents often affect only a few devices or a large amount of devices 
- this is why the important aspect is having a team since we can effectively together go through and look at the incidents and possible incidents that may happen
- This team is usually handled by a incident manager and the role is called SOC manager with the id of CISO/CIO \
