The hierarchy we want -> 

```C++
AI-IDS-Project/
│
├── backend/       # All backend-related files
│   ├── src/       # Python source files
│   ├── tests/     # Test scripts
│   ├── Dockerfile # Docker configuration for backend
│   └── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
│
├── frontend/      # All frontend-related files
│   ├── public/    # Public assets like index.html, icons
│   ├── src/       # React source files
│   ├── Dockerfile # Docker configuration for frontend
│   └── package.json       # NPM dependencies
│
├── docker-compose.yml  # Docker Compose file to orchestrate containers
└── README.md           # Project documentation

```

Commands we need to start the py environment 

```Python
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```


- Create a `requirements.txt` file to list your Python dependencies.
- Start adding your Python scripts in the `src` folder.


Command to start the React app 

```C++
npx create-react-app
```

- Structure your React components and services within the `src` folder.

#### Set up docker 

- Create a `Dockerfile` in the `backend` directory:

```C++
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY src/ .
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

**Dockerize the Frontend:**

1. Create a `Dockerfile` in the `frontend` directory:

```C++
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

#### Docker Compose

Open `docker-compose.yaml` file

```C++
version: '3.8'
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

- **Start with CPU:** Begin development using your CPU to ensure your system is functioning correctly and to simplify the setup process. This approach also helps in debugging without adding the complexity of GPU resources.
- **Optimize with GPU:** Once your system is stable and you're moving towards more intensive processing or larger datasets, start integrating your Nvidia 3070 to handle more demanding tasks.

We'll move onto GPU once we set up EndeavorOS on Our PC!


Once we have everything set up and want to start Docker we can use 

```C
docker-compose up
```

```C
docker-compose ps
```

- also there is the -d option which allows it to run in the background like what we did in GenCyber!

Also to activate the Python environment in the directory we navigate to the `venv` directory and move into bin then `source activate` to start the environment!

- then its deactivate to turn it off
