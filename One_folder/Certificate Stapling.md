- OCSP places a significant burden on the OCSP server operated by certificates authorities CA 
- website or other user of a digital certificate, verifying that the certificate is valid and hasn't been revoked. Certificate stapling is an extension to the Online Certificate Status Protocol that relieves some of the burden placed upon certificate authorities by the original protocol. Let's look at how certificate stapling works for a web server. 
- Certificate Stapling is an extenison to teh onlune status protocol that releives some of the burden placed 
- reduces the CA's burden 
- when user visits a web site the web site then sends the user its certificate using the users browser which normally responsible for contactiing an OCSP server 
- with stapling the web server contacts the OCSP server it self  
- then from the server the web servr then attaches or staples it to the digital certifiacte 
- once a user requests a sercure web connection the web server sends the cert with astaple ocsp resopnse to the user 
- the users browser then veridies that the cert is authentic and also validates teh stapled ocsp response in a genuine and recent 
- the user then knows that it comes form the CA because the ca signed and the ocsp responeded 
- it's just as much burden on the CA server as if the user requested the certificate, and in this one time use case, it is. The savings come when the next user visits the website. The web server can simply reuse the stapled certificate without recontacting the OCSP server. As long as the time stamp is recent enough, the user will accept the stapled certificate without needing to contact the CA's OCSP server again. It's common to have stapled certificates with a validity period of 24 hours. That reduces the burden on an OCSP server from handling one request per user over the course of a day.

### Certificate Stapling and OCSP

**Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)** is used to verify the validity of digital certificates in real time.

- However OCSP can place a huge burden on the OCSP servers 

#### Certificate Stapling

**Certificate Stapling** is an extension to the OCSP designed to allevaitte some of the burdens placed by the CA and the Original Protocol. 

- Allows the web servers to handle the part of the certificate validation process reducing the load on OCSP servers 

**How Certificate Stapling Works**:

1. **Initial User Visit**: When a user visits a website, the website sends its digital certificate to the user's browser. Normally, the user's browser would then contact the OCSP server to verify the certificate's validity.
2. **Server-Initiated OCSP Request**: With certificate stapling, the web server itself contacts the OCSP server to verify the certificate.
3. **Stapling the Response**: The OCSP server sends a response back to the web server, which then "staples" this response to its digital certificate.
4. **Sending the Stapled Certificate**: When a user requests a secure connection, the web server sends the stapled certificate along with the stapled OCSP response to the user.
5. **User Verification**: The user's browser verifies the authenticity of the certificate and validates the stapled OCSP response, ensuring it is genuine and recent.


**Efficiency and Reuse**:

- After the initial stapling, the web server can reuse the stapled certificate for subsequent users without recontacting the OCSP server, as long as the timestamp on the stapled response is recent enough (commonly within 24 hours).
- This reduces the number of OCSP requests made to the CA's servers, decreasing the load on the OCSP infrastructure.

### Important Points for Sec+ Exam

- **OCSP and Certificate Stapling**: Understand how OCSP works to validate digital certificates and how certificate stapling reduces the burden on CA servers.
- **Server-Initiated Validation**: Recognize that with certificate stapling, the web server handles the OCSP request and staples the response to the certificate, which is then sent to the user.
- **Efficiency of Stapled Certificates**: Be aware that stapled certificates can be reused for a set validity period (e.g., 24 hours), reducing the need for repeated OCSP requests.
