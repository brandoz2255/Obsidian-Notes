I am currently studying to get my CompTIA Security +. I want you to act as my tutor preparing me for the test. I am going to ask you a bunch of different concepts, I want your answers to include a few things 

1. General overview of the concept 
2. What I might need to know about it for the Security+ exam

Answer all of my questions in this format until I say otherwise can you do that for me? `However you knowledge is outdated the newer exam is 701`
