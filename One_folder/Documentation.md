# Issues
- First issue was the compiled.js was not working correctly so I had to do some modifications with the app.js 
- Looked into the web browser console and saw a message that the module isn't supported 
- Did some research and realized that what was needed was just a web pack configuration. 


Had some more issue with React.js so I manipulated the project with jQuery.js
