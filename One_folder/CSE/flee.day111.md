# subnetting take a step further
- the formula for subnet remember it [look it up lol]
- $$111111,.111111.00^{0000000.000000000000}$$
- there are two differnt ip addreses 
- # variable length
- subnet  mask 
- we have limited IP address 
	- in small networks we need to conserve ip adddreses 
	- sometimes we need more than one network 
	- how do we conserve these 
	- evryone and their mom need eight ip addresses 
	- NAT is important to make this possible 
	- the problem is in bigger net works we still need conserve ip addresses
	-

## VLSM 
- is further subnetting a divided with varying masks
- how many network bits is that on /17 
- something about slider with network bits 

General process 
- Find network address and mask\ 
- list network into segments using maks possible

 class c is the defaukt home network sbunet 
 usually like 
 - 192.168.0.0 with a defaukt of 124
 - also 255.255.255.0 convert it to binary 
 - then break down the subnet 
 - 32 -28 we are left  with  the host bits 16-31 42 - 37 \
 - this is usally the ip range 
 - remember the broadcast address look it up 
 - everyn time we add network its cutn half but that is becauswn the exponential equation

## Subnet cheat sheet
- the subnet cheat sheet and how to use it for vlsm 
- visualize a subnet with a  box d
- in this subnet if it is a /24 the total we have is 256 
- then  we can just keep cutting the box over and over again we can use this website for the example [subnetcalc](https://www.davidc.net/sites/default/subnets/subnets.html)

# Big concept 
- 9.9.9.0/24 
- do the subnet 

draw the representation at home
