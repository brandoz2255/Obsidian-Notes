Rust has several primitive data types, which can be categorized into scalar and compound types. Here's a comprehensive list of primitive data types in Rust and their usage:

## Scalar Types

## Boolean

- Type: `bool`
- Usage: Represents true or false values
- Example: `let is_active: bool = true;`

## Integer

- Signed: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, `isize`
- Unsigned: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `usize`
- Usage: Whole numbers without fractional components
- Example: `let age: u8 = 25;`

## Floating-Point

- Types: `f32`, `f64`
- Usage: Numbers with decimal points
- Example: `let pi: f64 = 3.14159;`
## Character

- Type: `char`
- Usage: Single Unicode scalar values
- Example: `let letter: char = 'A';`

## Compound Types

## Array

- Usage: Fixed-length collection of same-type elements
- Example: `let numbers: [i32; 5] =[1][2][3][4][5];`

## Tuple

- Usage: Fixed-length collection of elements of different types
- Example: `let person: (String, i32) = ("Alice".to_string(), 30);`

## Slice

- Usage: Dynamically-sized view into a contiguous sequence
- Example: `let slice: &[i32] = &numbers[1..4];`
- basically vector 

## String Slice

- Type: `&str`
- Usage: Immutable reference to a string
- Example: `let greeting: &str = "Hello, world!";`

## Other Primitive Types

## Unit Type

- Type: `()`
- Usage: Represents an empty value or empty return type
- Example: `let empty: () = ();`

Non-primitive data types, also known as `user-defined types`, are custom types created by programmers. In Rust, these include:

1. `Structs`: Custom data types that group related data
2. `Enums`: Types that can be one of several variants
3. `Unions`: Types that store different data types in the same memory location
4. `Trait Objects`: Abstract types representing a set of methods

These user-defined types allow for more complex data structures and are essential for creating custom abstractions in Rust programs[1](https://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-primitive-data-types-rust/)[5](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html)[8](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types.html).
