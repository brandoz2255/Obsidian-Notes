### Scalars and Vectors in Physics 

**Scalar**: 
- **Scalar**: A quantity that only has magnitude (eg., speed). Scalars do not include any information 

**Vectors**: 
- **Vector**: A quantity that includes both magnitude and direction (Speed + direction)
	- **Representation in physics**: 
		- **Magnitude**: The length of the vector represent its magnitude
		- **Notation**: Vectors can be represented as V with an arrow above it, **V** in bold or |V| to denote the magnitude (absolute value) of the vector

**Vector Operations**
- **Addition and Subtraction**:  
	- **A - B**: Subtracting vector B from vector A is equivalent to adding vector A to the negative of vector B, represented  as **A - B = A + (-B)**
	- **Tip to Tail Method**: When adding vectors, place the tail of the second vector at the tip of the first vector
- **Scalar Multiplication**: 
	- 3A: multiplying a vector by a scalar (3A) involves scaling the vectors magnitude by the scalar value, while maintaining its direction

#### Application in Computer Science and Cybersecurity

- **Vectors in CS & Cyber**: Vectors are fundamental in various computer science and cybersecurity applications, such as in graphics (representing movements and forces)
