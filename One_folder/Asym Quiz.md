What key is actually used to encrypt the contents of a message when using PGP?

    
- Randomly generated key

-----------------------------------

Which one of the following encryption approaches is most susceptible to a quantum computing attack?

Elliptic curve cryptography

Correct

Elliptic curve cryptography relies on the difficulty of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem, which quantum algorithms can solve more efficiently than classical algorithms.

-----------------------------------

Alice would like to send a message to Bob using RSA encryption. What key should she use to encrypt the message?

Bob's public key

This is because the sender uses the recipients  public key to encrpyt the message the recipient in this case being Bob

- When a user wants to send an encrypted message to another user with the RSA algorithm, the sender encrypts the message with the recipient's public key.

-----------------------------------

When you communicate over the Tor network, which of the following entities do you communicate with directly?

- Entry node
    
    Correct
    
    The entry node knows that the request comes from you and that the next step is node two.
