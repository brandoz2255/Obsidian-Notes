### Digital Signature Standard (DSS)

The **Digital Signature Standard (DSS)** is a government standard for the appropriate use of digital signatures algorithms in the Federal government

- Made by NIST with the most current version being FIPS 186-5 
- This 86 page documents the acceptance use of digital signatures

#### Supported Algorithms in DSS

The DSS supports three different algorithms, all of which are considered secure:

1. **Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)**
    
    - A widely-used public key cryptosystem that is also utilized for digital signatures.
2. **Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)**
    
    - A variant of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) that uses elliptic curve cryptography, offering the same level of security with smaller key sizes.
3. **Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)**
    
    - A modern digital signature scheme that uses a twisted Edwards curve, known for its performance and security. It is particularly resistant to side-channel attacks.

### Important Points for Sec+ Exam

- **Digital Signature Standard (DSS)**: Understand that DSS is the government standard for digital signature algorithms, established by NIST.
- **FIPS 186-5**: Be aware that FIPS 186-5 is the current version of the Digital Signature Standard, released in 2023.
- **Supported Algorithms**: Know the three algorithms supported by the DSS: RSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA, all of which are secure and used in federal applications.
