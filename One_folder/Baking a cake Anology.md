Imagine you're reading a recipe book on how to bake a cake. Each recipe lists ingredients along with the required amounts and instructions on how to mix them to make the cake.

#### Formal Parameters

In this analogy, **formal parameters** are like the ingredients listed in the recipe without specific values. For example, the recipe might say you need flour, sugar, eggs, and butter. Here, 'flour', 'sugar', 'eggs', and 'butter' are placeholders in the recipe. They tell you what types of ingredients are needed but not the specific ones you'll use or their quantities from your kitchen.

#### Actual Parameters

The **actual parameters** are the specific ingredients you use when you actually bake the cake. For instance, when the recipe calls for sugar, you go to your pantry and grab a cup of sugar from your sugar container. The sugar you measure and use is the actual parameter â€” it's the real, specific item used in the operation of baking the cake.
