### Preventive Controls

Preventive controls aim to stop threats before they can cause harm. They are proactive measures designed to prevent security incidents.

| Control Type | Category                                                                                                         | Example                                                                                                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Technical    | Technical controls are designed to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.                                 | Implementing firewalls and intrusion detection systems to monitor and block unauthorized access.                 |
| Managerial   | Managerial controls involve policies and procedures that guide employees on how to handle sensitive information. | Establishing a policy that requires all employees to use strong, unique passwords for accessing company systems. |
| Operational  | Operational controls focus on the day-to-day operations of an organization to ensure they are secure.            | Regularly updating and patching software to fix vulnerabilities.                                                 |
| Physical     | Physical controls involve securing physical assets to prevent unauthorized access.                               | Installing locks and surveillance cameras to secure data centers and offices.                                    |

### Deterrent Controls

Deterrent controls are designed to discourage potential attackers from attempting to breach the security of an organization.

|Control Type|Category|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Technical|Technical deterrents use technology to make an attack unattractive.|Implementing honeypots to attract and monitor potential attackers.|
|Managerial|Managerial deterrents involve policies and procedures that discourage unauthorized access.|Establishing a zero-tolerance policy for unauthorized access to company systems.|
|Operational|Operational deterrents focus on the operational environment to discourage attacks.|Regularly auditing and monitoring system logs to detect and deter unauthorized activities.|
|Physical|Physical deterrents involve securing physical assets to discourage unauthorized access.|Installing security guards and surveillance cameras to monitor and deter unauthorized access to physical locations.|

### Detective Controls

Detective controls are designed to identify and respond to security incidents after they have occurred.

|Control Type|Category|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Technical|Technical detective controls use technology to identify and respond to security incidents.|Implementing intrusion detection systems to monitor for unauthorized access attempts.|
|Managerial|Managerial detective controls involve policies and procedures that guide the response to security incidents.|Establishing an incident response plan that outlines steps to take when a security incident is detected.|
|Operational|Operational detective controls focus on the operational environment to identify and respond to security incidents.|Regularly reviewing system logs and network traffic to detect and respond to potential security threats.|
|Physical|Physical detective controls involve securing physical assets to prevent unauthorized access.|Installing surveillance cameras and alarms to monitor physical locations for unauthorized access.|

### Corrective Controls

Corrective controls are designed to address security incidents after they have occurred. They are reactive measures to mitigate the impact of a security breach.

|Control Type|Category|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Technical|Technical corrective controls use technology to mitigate the impact of a security breach.|Implementing backup and recovery systems to restore data in case of a breach.|
|Managerial|Managerial corrective controls involve policies and procedures that guide the response to security incidents.|Establishing a process for reporting and investigating security incidents.|
|Operational|Operational corrective controls focus on the operational environment to mitigate the impact of security incidents.|Regularly updating and patching software to fix vulnerabilities that could be exploited in a security breach.|
|Physical|Physical corrective controls involve securing physical assets to prevent unauthorized access.|Installing locks and surveillance cameras to secure physical locations after a security incident.|

### Compensating Controls

Compensating controls are designed to mitigate the risks associated with other controls that may not be fully effective. They are used to ensure that even if one control fails, the overall security posture remains strong.

|Control Type|Category|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Technical|Technical compensating controls use technology to mitigate the risks associated with other controls.|Implementing multi-factor authentication as a backup to single-factor authentication.|
|Managerial|Managerial compensating controls involve policies and procedures that complement other controls.|Establishing a policy for regular security training to compensate for the risks associated with human error.|
|Operational|Operational compensating controls focus on the operational environment to mitigate risks.|Regularly auditing and monitoring system logs to compensate for the risks associated with unauthorized access.|
|Physical|Physical compensating controls involve securing physical assets to mitigate risks.|Installing surveillance cameras and alarms as a backup to locks and keys to secure physical locations.|

### Directive Controls

Directive controls are designed to guide the behavior of individuals and organizations to ensure compliance with security policies and procedures.

|Control Type|Category|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Technical|Technical directive controls use technology to guide behavior.|Implementing access controls that require users to authenticate before accessing sensitive data.|
|Managerial|Managerial directive controls involve policies and procedures that guide behavior.|Establishing a policy that requires all employees to use strong, unique passwords for accessing company systems.|
|Operational|Operational directive controls focus on the operational environment to guide behavior.|Regularly updating and patching software to ensure that employees follow best practices for security.|
|Physical|Physical directive controls involve securing physical assets to guide behavior.|Installing locks and surveillance cameras to ensure that employees follow best practices for securing physical locations.|
