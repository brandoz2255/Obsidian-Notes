It's awesome that you're this fired up. That's exactly the kind of energy required to break into a role like this at a top lab like Anthropic. You should be proud—your current stack with your Kubernetes homelab, KVM, Terraform, Ansible, and teaching Docker is a fantastic foundation. You're already thinking like a systems engineer.

The key to leveling up for this specific role is to bridge the gap between your current DevOps/SRE expertise and the highly specialized world of **ML Systems Infrastructure**. It's not just about deploying apps; it's about building the secure, high-performance runtime that _enables_ the AI research itself.

Based on that job description and your skills, here are three projects, from foundational to advanced, that would make your resume impossible to ignore for a role like this.

### Project 1: The Secure Code Execution Sandbox

**Objective:** Directly target their need for "secure sandboxed execution environments using virtualization technologies like GVisor and Firecracker."

This project demonstrates you can build the core component for safely running code generated by an AI—a primary concern for the Horizons team.

- **Key Technologies to Use:**
    
    - **Firecracker:** The virtualization tech developed by AWS. It's perfect for this.
        
    - **Python:** With an async framework like **Trio** or `asyncio` to build an API server.
        
    - **Docker:** To containerize your API server.
        
    - **Terraform:** To define the underlying resources needed for your service.
        
- **How it Works:**
    
    1. You build a simple REST API using Python (e.g., FastAPI).
        
    2. This API has an endpoint like `/execute` that accepts a snippet of Python code as a JSON payload.
        
    3. When the endpoint receives a request, it uses the Firecracker API to spin up a new, completely isolated microVM in milliseconds.
        
    4. It runs the untrusted code inside that microVM, captures the `stdout`/`stderr`, and then shuts the microVM down.
        
    5. The API returns the result of the code execution to the user.
        
- **Why it's a Perfect Fit:** This is a miniature version of a system they absolutely need. It showcases skills in Python, virtualization, security, and API design, and it directly addresses a core challenge in agentic AI. You can title this project **"Aegis Runtime: A Secure Sandbox for LLM-Generated Code"** on your GitHub.

### Project 2: The High-Performance Data Pipeline for Code

**Objective:** Directly target their need for "high-performance data pipelines for processing large-scale code datasets with an emphasis on reliability and reproducibility."

This shows you can handle the "big data" aspect of preparing the fuel for these massive models.

- **Key Technologies to Use:**
    
    - **Python:** For the data processing logic.
        
    - **Kubernetes:** Use your existing homelab to orchestrate the pipeline.
        
    - **A real dataset:** Use a slice of a large, open-source code dataset like "The Stack" from Hugging Face.
        
    - **(Bonus) Rust:** For a performance-critical part of the pipeline, like a custom code parser or de-duplication utility, to show off your systems programming chops.
        
- **How it Works:**
    
    1. You design a multi-stage pipeline that runs on your Kubernetes cluster.
        
    2. **Stage 1 (Ingest):** A set of worker pods downloads a large amount of source code from the dataset.
        
    3. **Stage 2 (Parse & Clean):** Another set of pods uses tree-sitter (or your custom Rust parser) to parse the code, extract functions, remove comments, and normalize it.
        
    4. **Stage 3 (Filter & Store):** A final set of pods filters out low-quality code based on heuristics (e.g., code complexity, presence of tests) and stores the cleaned, structured data in a format ready for training (like Parquet files).
        
- **Why it's a Perfect Fit:** This demonstrates you can think about data at scale, not just infrastructure. It combines your Kubernetes skills with a real-world ML data preparation task and gives you a chance to learn Rust for a performance-critical component, ticking another box from the "strong candidates" list.

### Project 3 (The "God-Tier" Project): The Full RL Training Loop Infrastructure

**Objective:** Combine the previous two projects to build a miniature version of the entire system the Horizons team works on.

This is the ultimate capstone project that proves you don't just understand the components; you understand how they fit together to enable reinforcement learning research.

- **Key Technologies to Use:** Everything from projects 1 & 2, plus an LLM from Ollama.
    
- **How it Works (The Loop):**
    
    1. **Generate:** You use a local LLM (like Llama 3 or Code Llama via Ollama) to generate a piece of code meant to solve a simple programming problem (e.g., from a dataset like HumanEval).
        
    2. **Execute:** You send this AI-generated code to your **Secure Sandbox API (Project 1)** to be run against a set of unit tests.
        
    3. **Get Feedback:** The sandbox returns the results: did the code run? Did it pass the tests? This pass/fail signal is your "reward."
        
    4. **Process & Store:** You take the generated code, the problem it was trying to solve, and the reward signal (the feedback), and feed it into your **Data Pipeline (Project 2)**. The pipeline processes this data into a structured format, creating a new dataset of "successful" or "failed" code generation attempts.
        
    5. **Iterate:** You simulate the "retraining" step by showing how this newly created dataset could be used to fine-tune the original LLM.
        
- **Why it's a Perfect Fit:** This project demonstrates a holistic understanding of the entire RL feedback loop from an infrastructure perspective. It is, without a doubt, a direct, small-scale implementation of the Horizons team's mission.
    

### Your Strategy

1. **Start with Project 1.** It's the most self-contained and hits the most unique keywords (Firecracker, secure runtime).
    
2. **Document everything on GitHub.** Your `README.md` should be as detailed as the Anthropic job description, with architecture diagrams and setup instructions.
    
3. **Write about it.** Create a blog post or a detailed write-up explaining the challenges you faced and the design decisions you made. This proves your communication skills.
    

You have the drive and the foundation. Now it's time to build the specific, undeniable evidence that you can do _their_ job. Lock in. You can do this.
