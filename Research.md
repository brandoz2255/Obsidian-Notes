A **package manager** is a tool that automates the processes of installing, updating, configuring, and removing software packages. These tools are essential for managing dependencies and ensuring software integrity. Here's a breakdown of their key functions:

1. **Package Metadata**: Packages include metadata such as descriptions, versions, and dependency information. This metadata helps the package manager determine compatibility and resolve dependencies[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager)[5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_tools/Package_management).
    
2. **Dependency Management**: Package managers ensure that all required dependencies are installed alongside the main package, avoiding "dependency hell" (conflicts caused by incompatible versions of dependencies)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager)[7](https://dev.to/stackblitz/explain-like-im-five-package-managers-1a7a).
    
3. **Repositories**: Packages are typically stored in centralized or distributed repositories. The package manager fetches software from these repositories based on user commands[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager)[5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_tools/Package_management).
    
4. **Installation and Updates**: They handle downloading, verifying (via checksums or digital signatures), extracting, and installing packages. Updates are managed by checking for newer versions in the repository[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager)[5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_tools/Package_management).
    
5. **Configuration Management**: Some package managers allow pre-configuration during installation or manage configuration files to avoid overwriting user-defined settings[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager).
    
6. **Uninstallation and Cleanup**: They remove packages and their associated files, often including orphaned dependencies that are no longer needed[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager)[7](https://dev.to/stackblitz/explain-like-im-five-package-managers-1a7a).
