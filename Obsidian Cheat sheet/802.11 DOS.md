- This is when a DOS attack occurs on the 802.11 system which if we remember correctly this is just the wifi 
- This is an easy system to forget about but of course this also can be targeted for *denial of service* (DOS)

## Capturing 802.11 Traffic
- When we examine raw traffic coming from the Wifi we msut use a WIDS/WIPS system or a wireless interface that has a monitor mode 

Example of accessing the wireless interface:

```shell-session
00818@htb[/htb]$ iwconfig

wlan0     IEEE 802.11  ESSID:off/any  
          Mode:Managed  Access Point: Not-Associated   Tx-Power=20 dBm   
          Retry short  long limit:2   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Power Management:off
```

Example of airdump use:

Airmon-NG
```shell-session
00818@htb[/htb]$ sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

Found 2 processes that could cause trouble.
Kill them using 'airmon-ng check kill' before putting
the card in monitor mode, they will interfere by changing channels
and sometimes putting the interface back in managed mode

    PID Name
    820 NetworkManager
   1389 wpa_supplicant

PHY     Interface       Driver          Chipset

phy0    wlan0           rt2800usb       Ralink Technology, Corp. RT2870/RT3070
                (mac80211 monitor mode vif enabled for [phy0]wlan0 on [phy0]wlan0mon)
                (mac80211 station mode vif disabled for [phy0]wlan0)
```

#### Monitor Mode
```shell-session
00818@htb[/htb]$ sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
00818@htb[/htb]$ sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
00818@htb[/htb]$ sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
```

Then we can verify our interface in monitor mode using the iwconfig

```shell-session
00818@htb[/htb]$ iwconfig

wlan0mon  IEEE 802.11  Mode:Monitor  Frequency:2.457 GHz  Tx-Power=20 dBm   
          Retry short  long limit:2   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Power Management:off
```

```shell-session
00818@htb[/htb]$ sudo airodump-ng -c 4 --bssid F8:14:FE:4D:E6:F1 wlan0 -w raw

BSSID              PWR RXQ  Beacons    #Data, #/s  CH   MB   ENC CIPHER  AUTH ESSID
F8:14:FE:4D:E6:F1  -23  64      115        6    0   4  130   WPA2 CCMP   PSK  HTB-Wireless
```

- `-c` we can specify the AP channel and provide the bssid with the `--bssid` and then the id  and then the filename with the `-w `option

- We could also use tcpdump for  similar outcome

# Deauthentication Attacks 
- A Deauthentication attack works in which an attacker sends Deauthentication frams to a wrieless network and discoonnecting all users from the network. 
- They do it for the following reasons 

1. `To capture the WPA handshake to perform an offline dicionary attack`
    
2. `To cause general denial of service conditions`
    
3. `To enforce users to disconnect from our network, and potentially join their network to retrieve information`

How they work essentially is that when a device wants to connect to a 802.11 service (WiFi) they must go through the handshake process in which they exchange frames

- The deauthenticaction works in which the attacker send false or forged frames that tell the WiFI service that this devices is disconnected

### FInding Deauthentication attacks
To look at these potential attacks we can look at the capture file using Wireshark

```shell-session
00818@htb[/htb]$ sudo wireshark deauthandbadauth.cap
```


- to limit the view of MAC addresses we would use the following command in wireshark 

```Wireshark
`wlan.bssid == xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx`
```

![[Screenshot from 2023-12-03 20-53-57.png]]

```Wireshark
`(wlan.bssid == xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx) and (wlan.fc.type == 00) and (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 12)`
```

- We can use this command syntax to basically look at our BSSID or an attacker pretending to be on our BSSID

If we see abounch of deauthenticaion frames beign used we might notice that code 7 was utilized we can check with this command sytnax

```Wireshark
(wlan.bssid == F8:14:FE:4D:E6:F1) and (wlan.fc.type == 00) and (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 12) and (wlan.fixed.reason_code == 7)

![Excessive Reason Code 7](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/229/4-deauth.png)
```

### Reason codes
An attacker might be more knowledgeable to not use reason code 7 so in this case we need to think like the attacker 

```Wireshark
(wlan.bssid == F8:14:FE:4D:E6:F1) and (wlan.fc.type == 00) and (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 12) and (wlan.fixed.reason_code == 1)`
```

then increment the levels to discover the attacker

- Dealing with deauthentication is a pain this how we can workaround it

1. `Enable IEEE 802.11w (Management Frame Protection) if possible`
2. `Utilize WPA3-SAE`
3. `Modify our WIDS/WIPS detection rules`

```Wireshark
(wlan.bssid == F8:14:FE:4D:E6:F1) and (wlan.fc.type == 00) and (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0) or (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 1) or (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 11)`
```

- We can find failed authentication attempts with this script 

![[Screenshot from 2023-12-03 21-11-54.png]]

`wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x0c`

- This command syntax the one in purple is the common command syntax for deauthentication
