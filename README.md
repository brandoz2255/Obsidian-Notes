This one is specifically for the Obsidian notes repo just letting you the files them selves are a little unorganized will fix when i have more time but it fits so well in the graph view of Obsidian. 

- This is just my notes that I have done studying Computer Science and Cyber security 
- This is a little unorganized will organize it when I have more time to do so but If you like to see them use the graph view of Obsidian really helps me navigate through them
