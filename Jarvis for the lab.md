# Features


- [[formal plan of features]]
- Verbal Chat and Verbal response

Jarves him self with do this -->
- Browser Automation must integrate more NLP
- OS automation using the OS library More NLP 
Micro Jarves instances and his agents will  handle the rest 
- SEL Automation with Ansible 
	- This will be on the Proxxmox boxes 
	- using ansible to  automate Terraform machines on the proxxmox boxes 
	- use REST api for other machines connection to Jarves
	- To allow Jarves when spoken to  verbally it can create VMs on the nucks with ease for either red teaming practice  wiith kali vms or blue teaming practice via vulnhub machines for hardening or too  do red teaming on the red team machines a mini cyber lab with a micro instance of Jarves 
- Computer Vision to see user
	- using  Jetson Orin Nanos or pi 
	- REST api to activate it and send info etc etc
	- Or just a simple camera  any camera will do honestly 
- micro-instances of  Jarves on pi's like the log in tool scanner web page for scanning rfid possibly and 
- Best Idea is somehow contacting Cline either via  custom extension for Jarves to comunicate to Cline verbally or with computer Vision 
	- communicate either  with Clines API it has one or its own MCP server it also has one or create a custom  vs code extension (more harder path however will try API and MCP first)
	- Goal to verbally vibe code cuz why not I say I would an application for  so and so boom Jarves prompts cline and runs the vibe coding agent in vs code which is basically the workflow I want for every agentic tasks ive listed before this
- Jarvis main AI him self will do the rest as well
- generate  no code platform automations and workflows for n8n and comfyUI for blender 3d 
	- n8n uses json for creating workflows or manually creating the graphs in the web page could have jarvise create the json or browser automation for the workflowss 
	- ComfyUI is different need to research more on how it could do automation when verbally tasked 
- Where  Jarvis  would deploy workflows in n8n and comfyUI
