## **What is Podman?**

Podman is a container management tool that can run containers without requiring a daemon like Docker or containerd. It uses the same OCI standards as Docker but focuses on:

- Running containers as non-root users.
- Managing pods (groups of containers) natively, similar to Kubernetes.

`Podman` is often used in conjunction with `CRI-O` in `OpenShift` environments[1](https://artkai.io/blog/best-containerization-tools).
