## Overview of Changes

This documentation explains how we configured Tailwind CSS v4 with `Next.js` for our `cybersecurity dashboard`. `Tailwind v4` introduces significant changes to how it's configured and used compared to previous versions.

## Key Configuration Files

### 1. `globals.css`

**Previous Issue:**
In our initial implementation, we used the traditional Tailwind CSS v3 approach with directives:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

And tried to use the new `@config` directive without proper PostCSS configuration:

```css
@config "./tailwind.config.js";
```

**Solution:**
For Tailwind CSS v4, we switched to the new import syntax and removed the `@config` directive:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss';
```

**Why it works:**

- Tailwind CSS v4 uses a new import-based approach instead of directives
- The `@import 'tailwindcss'` statement imports all of Tailwind's styles
- This approach doesn't require the `@config` directive which was causing errors
- We defined custom CSS classes directly in the file rather than using Tailwind's utility classes

### 2. `postcss.config.mjs`

**Previous Issue:**
We didn't have a properly configured `PostCSS` file for Tailwind `v4`.

**Solution:**
We created a `PostCSS` configuration file that uses the new `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin:


```js
/** @type {import('postcss').Config} */
export default {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
  },
}
```

**Why it works:**

- `Tailwind CSS v4` uses a new `PostCSS` plugin called `@tailwindcss/postcss`
- This plugin handles the processing of Tailwind's styles
- The configuration is minimal as `Tailwind v4` requires zero configuration by default
- Using `.mjs` extension ensures it's treated as an ES module

### 3. `tailwind.config.js`

**Previous Issue:**
We were trying to use a complex configuration with HSL color values and shadcn/ui integration.

**Solution:**
While we still have a tailwind.config.js file, it's not actively used in our current implementation since we're using direct CSS variables and custom classes.

**Why it works:**

- Tailwind CSS v4 doesn't require a configuration file by default
- Our approach uses direct CSS variables and custom classes instead of relying on Tailwind's utility classes
- This makes the styling more explicit and less dependent on Tailwind's configuration
