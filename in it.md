In this code:

- We define a `Character` class with a constructor that initializes the character's name, age, and faction. These attributes are private, meaning they can only be accessed within the class itself.
- The `introduce` method is a public method that prints out a greeting message including the character's name, age, and faction.
- In the `main` function, we create an instance of the `Character` class named `new_character` with the name "John Doe", age 25, and faction "Vault Dweller".
- Finally, we call the `introduce` method on `new_character` to display a message introducing the character.
