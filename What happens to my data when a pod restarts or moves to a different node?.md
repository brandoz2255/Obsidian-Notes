**If the pod uses a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) b1acked by a Persistent Volume (PV) with network-attached storage or cloud storage,** The volume is independent  of the node and data it self remains intact. The PVC "Follows" the pod essentially 

- When the pods restart or is rescheduled on a different node k8s just attaches them again  to the PV on the new node 
- If the PV or PVC is a local volume via hostPath or local disk then the data is physically tied to that node 
- Thiis  means if the pod moves to another noode the volume does not move automatically
