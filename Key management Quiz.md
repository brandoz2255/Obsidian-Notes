## Question 1 of 5

In the early 1990s, the National Security Agency attempted to introduce key escrow using what failed technology?

Clipper chip

Correct

The clipper chip performed encryption, but it included a special law enforcement access field, or LEAF, value that allowed government agents to access the content of the communication.

## Question 3 of 5

Which one of the following is an example of an in-band approach to key exchange?


Diffie-Hellman

Correct

An in-band key exchange algorithm like Diffie-Hellman allows the sender and the receiver to exchange a secret key over the network, even if they don't have a secure way to communicate with each other in advance.
