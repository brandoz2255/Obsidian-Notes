- **policy engine**: component or system that enforces security policies across a network or within an application
	- is responsible for making decisions based on predefined rules or policies to control access, manage network traffic, and ensure compliance with security standards
	- Policy engines can be found in various forms of security appliances, such as `firewalls`, `intrusion detection systems` (IDS), and `network access control` (NAC) systems
	- **Compliance and Risk Management**: how policy engines can be integrated with other security tools, such as `firewalls` and `IDS` 

- **Policy Administrator**: This individual is responsible for defining, implementing, and enforcing security policies within an organization.
	- **Security Policy Development**: Policy Administrators are responsible for developing and implementing security policies that align with the organization's risk tolerance and compliance requirements [2](https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-security-administrator)[4](https://www.comptia.org/faq/security/what-is-comptia-security-certification).
	- **Compliance and Governance**: Policy Administrators must ensure that the organization's security policies comply with relevant laws, regulations, and standards [1](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security)[4](https://www.comptia.org/faq/security/what-is-comptia-security-certification).


-  **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)**: The PEP is responsible for enforcing the policies that determine who can access what resources under what conditions.
	- It is a key component in systems that implement Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and other access control models.
	- **Access Control Models**: Familiarity with different access control models, such as ABAC and RBAC, is crucial. Understanding how a PEP fits into these models 
	- **Policy Management**: It evaluates access requests against these policies to determine whether access should be granted or denied.

 - **Implicit Trust Zone**:  therefore, refers to a part of the network or system that is assumed to be trustworthy without explicit verification. 
	 - **Zero Trust Principles**: The concept of an Implicit Trust Zone is directly related to the Zero Trust model, which emphasizes the need for verification before granting access.
	 - **Network Security Tools and Technologies**: This includes understanding how to configure and use firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and other security tools to enforce access controls and monitor network traffic [1](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/globalassets/documents/comptia-security-sy0-701-exam-objectives-5-0-1.pdf).

- **Adaptive identity**:  dynamic and flexible approach to identity management and access control
	- goes beyond, assign fixed roles and permissions to users, to a more nuanced and context-aware system
	- *Adaptive identity* systems can adjust access rights and permissions based on various factors such as the user's location, the time of access, the type of device being used, and the sensitivity of the data being accessed.
	- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Adaptive identity is a key component of IAM strategies. Understanding how adaptive identity systems can enhance IAM by providing more granular and context-aware access controls is crucial for the Security+ exam
	- **Security Posture**: Adaptive identity systems contribute to a more robust security posture by reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
	- **Risk Management**: Adaptive identity systems can help manage risks associated with identity theft and unauthorized access by providing more precise control over access rights
	- **Compliance and Governance**: Adaptive identity systems can support compliance with various security standards and regulations by providing a flexible and context-aware approach to access control.

- **Threat scope reduction**:  strategic approach of minimizing the potential impact of cyber threats by focusing on the most critical and vulnerable areas of an organization's IT infrastructure.
	- This involves identifying and prioritizing threats based on their potential impact, vulnerabilities, and the likelihood of exploitation. By concentrating efforts on these areas
	- **Risk-Based Approach**: Embracing a risk-based cybersecurity approach involves understanding the current threat landscape, identifying potential threats, and prioritizing them based on their risk to the organization's critical assets
		- This approach is crucial for shifting from a reactive to a proactive cybersecurity posture [2](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/ciso/22/d/proactive-cyber-risk-management-strategies.html).\
	- **Asset Identification and Classification**: Many organizations struggle with visibility into their entire attack surface, leading to challenges in securing assets and data.
	- **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement**: Centralizing visibility across the attack surface is key for continuous risk management and adapting to the evolving threat landscape
	- **Tailored Security Measures**: Implementing controls that are specifically designed to protect the most critical assets against the most likely threats ensures a targeted and effective defense strategy

- **Policy-Driven Access Control (PBAC)**: It combines the principles of role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) to provide a flexible and granular method for determining who can access what resources under what conditions.
	- These policies can be tailored to the specific needs of an organization, ensuring that access is granted based on both the user's role and the attributes of the resources being accessed [2](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/policy-based-access-control/)[5](https://nordlayer.com/learn/access-control/policy-based-access-control/).
	- It provides a framework for managing user access in a single model type, which supports organizational risk management objectives and supports business agility without compromising usability or security [2](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/policy-based-access-control/).
	-  **Principle of Least Privilege (POLP)**: Implementing PBAC should include adhering to the Principle of Least Privilege, which involves granting users only the permissions they need to perform their job. This principle helps reduce the risk of data breaches and other security incidents [2](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/policy-based-access-control/).

-  **internal network zone, often referred to as a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)** : internal network zone is to enhance security by segregating critical systems and sensitive data from potential external threats. 
	- It allows for controlled but limited access to specific services from the internet while minimizing the risk of unauthorized access to the internal network.
	- You should be able to explain how a DMZ acts as a buffer zone between the internal network and the external network
	- firewalls in controlling traffic, the segregation of public-facing services from critical internal resources
	- **Benefits of a DMZ**: Understand the benefits of implementing a DMZ, such as enhancing the security of an organization's network infrastructure, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to internal resources, and providing a controlled environment for public-facing services.

- **external network zone**: referred to as the internet or the public network, is the part of the network that is accessible to the public.
	- It is the area where devices and systems are exposed to the internet, making it a critical area for security measures.
	- **Security Measures**: security measures that can be implemented in the external network zone, such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and web filtering.
	- **Perimeter Networks**: Understand the concept of perimeter networks, which are often used to provide an additional layer of security between the external network zone and the internal network
	- **Zero Trust**: no user or device is trusted by default, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the network perimeter.
