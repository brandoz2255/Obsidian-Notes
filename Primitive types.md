primitive types. In Rust:

1. For primitive types like integers, there isn't typically a `new()` method. Instead, you would use literals or type conversion.
2. Rust uses lowercase names for primitive types. So instead of `Integer`, you'd use `i32`, `i64`, `u32`, etc., depending on the specific integer type you need.

Here are some examples of how you might create integers in Rust:

```rust
let a = 5; // Rust infers the type, usually i32
let b: i64 = 10; // Explicitly specifying the type
let c = i32::default(); // Creates a default value (0 for integers)
let d = 0_i64; // Another way to specify type for a literal
```
For more complex types that do have a `new()` method, your intuition is correct. For example:

```rust
let vec = Vec::new(); // Creates a new vector
let map = HashMap::new(); // Creates a new hash map
```

So while the syntax is similar to what you suggested, the specific case of `Integer::new()` isn't used in Rust due to how primitive types are handled.
