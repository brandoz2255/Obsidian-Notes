[Cleaned_input[::-1]]: **uses slicing to reverse the string**
The Slicing [syntax:[::-1]] ***ignore the first brackets for everything*** means to start at the end of the string and move backwards one unit at a time

***words = [word.strip('.,!?').lower() for word in words]***
* when a code is brackets that means that this is a list comprehension
* List Comprehension are a concise way to create lists by performing operation on each element of an existing iterable 
* Iterating through words: example how the[ ***for*** word ***in*** words means] that part of the list comprehension iterates through each word in the 'words' list and then assigned it to the variable 'word'
* what is withing the brackets in a code is also called an element which means it would be a list in python terms 
* Python just like linux starts their list at 0 instead of 1
* bicycles = ['list1', 'list 2' , 'list 3', 'list 4']
* print(bicycles0[1]) would print out [list1][] 
* [[using int()]]
