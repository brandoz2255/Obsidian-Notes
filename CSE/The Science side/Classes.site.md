Classes in Python relate to the Idea of types in C++ [[Chapter 2 Types]] 
## Types 
-  Python it self like many programming languages gives us many different ways to store data such as float which as we know now an estimation of a real number
- Int is the just the whole number itself
- list stores data in the list which we call a dictionaries 

All these collevtively are called different types and we can check the type of variable using the `type()` Function

```Python
a_string = "Cool String"
an_int = 12

print(type(a_string))
# prints "<class 'str'>"

print(type(an_int))
# prints "<class 'int'>"
```

- With this code snipet we defined two variables and checked the type these two variables to determine what we can do with it 
- Remember we can `.get()` something from a `int` type or combine dictionaries 

- So basically overall we can define what is in the variable using the `type()` function in Python 

```Python
my_dict = {

"a": "apple",

"b": "Bannana",

"c": "Coconut",

}

type(my_dict)
```

- Since we struggled with the concept of what a dictionary was in python essentially its just a list of words that are defined like in the snipet and like an actual definition of a dictionary in IRL
