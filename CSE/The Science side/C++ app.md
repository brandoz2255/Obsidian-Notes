ok we will make this the to do list APP for now lets brainstorm like what should we add to it. 

# R.A.D.A.R
Reminder And Deadline Assistance Remote 

## Abilities that it can do 
- create a table i which it displays the shit that I need to do for that day 
- Lets be more objective on the idea it ask the user to make a List of what the user has to do that day 
- Then it ask the user to specify how much time will be needed to do said task
- Then it asks for a description of the tasks(optional)
- Then it generates a table of the to do list 
- saves the to do list in a file (or asks the user if they want to)
- Definitely want to implement a notification  side such as every 4 minutes a reminder of my tasks 
- Also needs the ability to import file in case my laptop or the program ends in case once the list is first made it makes the file of the to do list 
- and then we run the app again it takes the list from the file and allowing our application to modify it and save it again but as the modified version
