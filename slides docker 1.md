**What is Docker?**

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
    - System-level virtualization
    - Isolated containers bundling software, libraries, and configurations
- **Open-Source Containerization Platform**
    - Standardizes application deployment
    - Independent of underlying OS and infrastructure

**Docker's Key Features**

- **Portability**: Consistent performance across environments
- **Reproducibility**: Ensures consistent software setup
- **Efficiency**: Optimizes resource utilization
- **Scalability**: Facilitates easy application scaling

**Docker in Cybersecurity**

- **Portable Environments**: Containerized tools (e.g., Kali Linux) across OS platforms
- **Virtual Labs**: Red vs. blue team simulations, flexible training environments

**Key Components of Docker**

- **Docker Engine**: Core part responsible for container management
- **Docker Image**: Read-only template for creating containers
- **Docker Hub**: Cloud-based repository for sharing containers and images
- **Dockerfile**: Script defining steps to create Docker images
- **Docker Registry**: Storage and distribution system for Docker images
