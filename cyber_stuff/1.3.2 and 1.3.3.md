  # Conditionals statements

**Conditional Statements** Basically statements that work under/execute when a certain condition is met for example if else statements or switch statements. 

Switch statement
```JS
let fruit = 'apple';

switch (fruit) {
 case 'banana':
    console.log('Bananas are good for health.');
    break;
 case 'apple':
    console.log('Apples are tasty.');
    break;
 default:
    console.log('I love all fruits.');
}
```

If else statements

```JS
let age = 15;

if (age >= 18) {
 console.log('You are an adult.');
} else {
 console.log('You are a minor.');
}
```

The *`consequent statement`* is the **`epression/statement`** that follows a case in a switch statement or a if else block for example `console.log('You are an adult.');` in the switch example it would be `console.log('Apples are tasty.')` 


**General methods of computation**:  the broad categories of techniques and approaches used in solving computational problems

Such examples are -> 

- **Algorithms**: These are step-by-step procedures for solving problems or performing calculations. Algorithms can be numerical (dealing with numbers and mathematical operations) or non-numerical (involving logical operations).
- **Computational Models**: These are mathematical representations of real-world systems or phenomena. Computational models are used to simulate the behavior of these systems under various conditions.
- **Computer Simulations**: Simulations are virtual environments that mimic real-world scenarios. They are used to test hypotheses, predict outcomes, and understand complex systems without the need for physical experiments.

## Industry Practice 

**Industry Applications**: in engineering, simulations are used to test the performance of new designs under various conditions before they are built. 
- In finance, computational models are used to predict market trends and optimize investment strategies.
- **Computer Science** : In computer science, understanding and applying computational methods is fundamental. They are used in developing software, optimizing algorithms, and solving complex computational problems
	-  For instance, in data science, computational methods are used to analyze large datasets and extract meaningful insights.

**Bisection Method**:  is an algorithm for solving numerical problems  , designed to find the root of a continuous function within a given interval where one end of the interval has a positive value, and the other end has a negative value.

-  particularly useful in scenarios where an initial approximation to the root is required, which can then be refined using more sophisticated methods.
- - The method's simplicity and reliability make it a valuable tool for educational purposes and as a starting point for more complex numerical analysis techniques [2](https://www.studysmarter.co.uk/explanations/engineering/engineering-mathematics/bisection-method/)[4](https://typeset.io/questions/how-does-the-bisection-method-work-500zrt6uwg)[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method).

Remember not all algorithms are effective methods this is just an educational value 

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

// Function to find the root using bisection method
double bisectionMethod(double a, double b, double epsilon) {
    double c = a;
    while ((b - a) >= epsilon) {
        // Find midpoint
        c = (a + b) / 2;

        // Check if midpoint is root
        if (fabs(c) < epsilon)
            break;

        // Decide the side to repeat the steps
        if ((c * a) > 0)
            a = c;
        else
            b = c;
    }
    return c;
}

int main() {
    double a = -10; // Initial left value
    double b = 10;  // Initial right value
    double epsilon = 0.0001; // Tolerance

    double root = bisectionMethod(a, b, epsilon);

    cout << "Root of the equation: " << root << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

```Python 
import math

# Function to find the root using bisection method
def bisection_method(a, b, epsilon):
    c = a
    while (b - a) >= epsilon:
        # Find midpoint
        c = (a + b) / 2.0

        # Check if midpoint is root
        if abs(c) < epsilon:
            break

        # Decide the side to repeat the steps
        if (c * a) > 0:
            a = c
        else:
            b = c
    return c

def main():
    a = -10  # Initial left value
    b = 10   # Initial right value
    epsilon = 0.0001  # Tolerance

    root = bisection_method(a, b, epsilon)

    print("Root of the equation:", root)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Fixed Point**: a fixed point of a function (f) is a value (x) such that$(f(x) = x)$. 
- concept is central to various areas of computer science, including lattice theory, recursion theory, and fixed-point computation.
-  *lattice theory*, fixed points are used to analyze monotone functions on lattices, with important results such as *Kleene's fixed*-point theorem and the Knaster-Tarski theorem.
- which guarantees the existence of a fixed point for continuous functions that map a unit cube to itself [1](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/3466/fixed-point-what-does-it-mean-in-the-world-of-computer-science)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_computation).

- **Industry Applications**: Fixed-point computation is used in various fields, including economics for computing market equilibrium, game theory for computing Nash equilibrium, and in dynamic system analysis.
	- The concept is particularly relevant in industries that require the analysis of complex systems or the optimization of systems under certain conditions [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_computation).

- **Oscillation**: refers to the periodic fluctuation between two states based on changes in energy. This concept is fundamental in various fields, including physics, engineering, and computer science.
	- The operation of an oscillator involves a feedback mechanism where the output is fed back into the input, allowing the signal to regenerate and sustain itself. 
	- This feedback process is crucial for maintaining the oscillation [2](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/oscillator)[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_oscillator).

 - **Computer Science**: Electronic oscillators are used to generate signals in computers, wireless receivers and transmitters, and audio equipment
	 - Understanding oscillators is crucial for developing algorithms and systems that rely on periodic signals for their operation [2](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/oscillator)[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_oscillator).

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

#define PI 3.14159265

int main() {
    double frequency = 2.0;  // Frequency of oscillation
    double amplitude = 1.0;  // Amplitude of oscillation
    double time = 0.0;       // Time variable
    double step_size = 0.1;  // Step size for time

    while (time < 10.0) {  // Run the loop for 10 seconds
        // Calculate the value of the oscillation using sine function
        double value = amplitude * sin(2 * PI * frequency * time);

        // Print the time and the value of the oscillation
        printf("Time: %.2f, Value: %.2f\n", time, value);

        // Increment time by step size
        time += step_size;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**First-class functions**:  A programming language is said to have first-class functions when it treats functions as first-class citizens, meaning that functions in that language are treated like any other variable.

- This includes the ability to pass functions as arguments to other functions, return them as values from other functions
-  and assign them to variables or store them in data structures.

The concept of first-class functions is crucial for the functional programming paradigm, which heavily relies on higher-order functions, i.e., functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results [1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First-class_Function)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function).

**Computer Science**: They enable the creation of more modular and reusable code, allowing developers to write more abstract and higher-level functions. 
-  This is particularly useful in areas such as algorithm design, data processing, and software architecture
- where the ability to pass functions as arguments or return them from other functions can significantly simplify the implementation of complex logic [1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First-class_Function)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function).

```Js
// Higher-order function that takes another function as an argument
function higherOrderFunction(func, x) {
    const result = func(x);
    console.log(`Result from higher-order function: ${result}`);
}

// First-class function
function square(x) {
    return x * x;
}

// Pass the first-class function 'square' to the higher-order function
higherOrderFunction(square, 5);

// Define and pass a lambda function to the higher-order function
higherOrderFunction(
    // Inline function that doubles the input
    // This is a lambda function in JavaScript
    (x) => x * 2, 
    7
);

```
