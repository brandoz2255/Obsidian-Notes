 - what is a radian i 1 radian

# Radians in trig
- **`Radian`** is the unit of measure in which it is the measure of  the angle when the vertex is at the center of the circle, subtends an arc equal in length to the radius of r. 
	- Like for example we have the full circle at $2\pi r$  

- **`Arc length`**  is integrating the formula that takes into account of the curves derivative 
	- Also the arc length in the unit circle is the distance along the edge of the circle

half of a circle is 180 degrees which is $\pi$ and 360 is doubled that which is the full circle which means that is $2 \pi$

- **Periodic function of time**: What is a period in trig it refers to the length of the interval of time in which a functions values repeat themselves. 
	- in other words it is the distance along the x-axis where the function starts to repeat its pattern 
		- the beggining of the pattern all the way until the end 
	- sine and cosine usually have a periodic function of $2 \pi$ which means it repeats every $2 \pi$.
		- In calculus the period varies from function to function consider the function -> 

$$C + B sin(Ax)$$

where  `B` is amplitude `C` is the stretch/shift and `A` is the period

$$C = min + amp$$

$$B = \frac{{\text{{max}} - \text{{min}}}}{2} 
$$

$$A= \frac{{{{2 \pi}}{{}}}}{f} $$

in which A = period and f is the frequency if the frequency is not already in pi radians then use the formula for A for example 

$$y= 2+8\cos\left(4x\right)$$

where $A = \frac{2\pi}{4} =  \frac{\pi}{2}$   

The same goes for cosine just 

$$C + Bcos(Ax)$$

- Sin and Cos graph 
	- Sin() is the graph that should usually always start from x 
	- where cos() should usually always start from y 


$$T = \frac{2\pi}{10 \pi} = \frac{\pi}{5} ) seconds$$
