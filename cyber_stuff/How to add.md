Creating a new repo is like setting up the stage for your show. Here's the script:

1. **Initialize a New Git Repo:**
    
    bash
    

- `git init`
    
    This sets up a new Git repository in your current directory.
    
- **Add All Files:**
    
    bash
    
- `git add .`
    
    This stages all your files for the initial commit.
    
- **Commit the Initial Changes:**
    
    bash
    
- `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
    
    This commits your files to the local repository.
    
- **Create a New Repo on GitHub:**
    
    - Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
    - Copy the URL of your new repo.
- **Link Local Repo to GitHub Repo:**
    
    bash
    
- `git remote add origin <your_repo_url>`
    
    This links your local repo to the one on GitHub.
    
- **Push Initial Changes to GitHub:**
    
    bash
    

1. `git push -u origin main`
    
    This sends your local files to the GitHub repo.
