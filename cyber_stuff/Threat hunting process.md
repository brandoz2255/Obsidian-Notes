- **Setting the Stage:**
    
    - _Planning and preparation phase focusing on clear target setting, environment readiness, and staying informed about cyber threats._
- **Formulating Hypotheses:**
    
    - _Making testable predictions derived from various sources, guiding the hunt based on recent threat intelligence, industry updates, or security alerts._
- **Designing the Hunt:**
    
    - _Developing a hunting strategy, identifying data sources, methodologies, and tools, and specifying indicators of compromise (IoCs) or patterns to hunt for._
- **Data Gathering and Examination:**
    
    - _Actively collecting and analyzing data, such as log files and network traffic, using predetermined methodologies and tools to find evidence supporting or refuting initial hypotheses._
- **Evaluating Findings and Testing Hypotheses:**
    
    - _Interpreting results to confirm or disprove hypotheses, understanding threat behavior, identifying affected systems, and assessing potential impact._
- **Mitigating Threats:**
    
    - _Undertaking remediation actions, such as isolating affected systems, eliminating malware, patching vulnerabilities, or adjusting configurations._
- **After the Hunt:**
    
    - _Documenting and sharing findings, updating threat intelligence platforms, refining incident response playbooks, and enhancing security policies based on lessons learned._
- **Continuous Learning and Enhancement:**
    
    - _Iteratively reviewing and improving hypotheses, methodologies, and tools for ongoing effectiveness, incorporating lessons learned and adapting to the evolving threat landscape._
