Given your interest in IoT devices and automation, Python seems like the perfect language for you. Here are a few project ideas that might inspire you:

1. **Home Automation System**: You could create a home automation system that controls various aspects of your home like lights, fans, security cameras, etc. This could involve interfacing with various IoT devices and controlling them remotely. There are several Python libraries available that can help you with this, like Paho-MQTT for communication with IoT devices [2](https://medium.com/@VAISHAK_CP/python-for-iot-connecting-and-controlling-devices-3f1c7f7e9423).

2. **Weather Station**: Another interesting project could be setting up a weather station that measures parameters like temperature, humidity, pressure, etc., and sends this data to a server or a local interface. You could use Python's datetime module to timestamp the measurements, and send them to a server using HTTP requests.
    

3. **Smart Plant Monitoring System**: You could create a system that monitors various parameters of plants like soil moisture, light intensity, temperature, etc., and sends alerts when certain thresholds are crossed. This could involve interfacing with sensors and sending alerts via email or push notifications.

**question:** Are you asking if you need separate hardware devices for the weather station and plant monitoring system, or if you can use your existing computer?

Yes, you can definitely use your existing computer for both the weather station and plant monitoring system. These systems typically require sensors (like temperature sensors, humidity sensors, etc.) which can be connected to your computer. The Python scripts running on your computer can read data from these sensors and process it.

As for your idea of creating a separate site to store the data from the weather station and plant monitoring system, it sounds like a great idea! It would allow you to visualize the data, analyze trends over time, and potentially share the data with others. You could use a database to store the data and a web framework like Django or Flask to create the website. You could also consider using a service like Google Sheets or Excel to store and visualize the data, especially if you're not familiar with databases or web development.
