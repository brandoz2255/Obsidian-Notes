**Project Idea: DDoS and DoS Attack Detection and Mitigation System**

This project involves creating a system that can detect and mitigate DDoS and DoS attacks. Python has several libraries that can help with this, such as Scapy for packet manipulation and analysis, and PyShark for parsing network traffic.

Here's a high-level overview of what the system could do:

1. **Traffic Monitoring**: Use Scapy or PyShark to monitor network traffic. Look for sudden spikes in traffic volume, as these could indicate a DDoS or DoS attack.

2. **Anomaly Detection**: Implement machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in network traffic. Libraries like scikit-learn can be used for this purpose.

3. **Attack Identification**: Once an anomaly is detected, classify whether it's a DDoS or DoS attack. This could be done based on the characteristics of the traffic (e.g., source IP addresses, packet size, etc.).

4. **Mitigation Strategies**: If an attack is detected, implement strategies to mitigate it. This could involve blocking the offending IP addresses, rerouting traffic, or even launching a counterattack.

5. **Alerts and Logging**: Keep detailed logs of all activities and send alerts to the team when an attack is detected. This will allow the team to respond quickly and effectively.

Remember, this is a complex project that involves advanced topics in networking and cybersecurity. It's important to thoroughly understand these concepts before attempting to implement them.
