As not a surprise there is more to programming than making functions in the development of a program we must consider the functions and estimate what said function can do as in learn to read and predict the action of a function. 

- Under stand the processes of what a function will do 
- We do this in order to have a complete understanding of what we have created and generate 
- A function is a process of the **local evolution** of a *computational process* ==Where each stage of the process is built off of another== 

```JS 
// Recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
    // Base case: factorial of 0 and 1 is 1
    return 1;
  } else {
    // Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}

// Example usage:
const result = factorial(5);
console.log(result); // Output: 120

```

Explanation 
``` Shell
Here's how the process evolves locally:

    factorial(5) calls factorial(4)
        factorial(4) calls factorial(3)
            factorial(3) calls factorial(2)
                factorial(2) calls factorial(1)
                    factorial(1) returns 1 (base case)
                factorial(2) multiplies 2 with the result from the previous step (1)
            factorial(3) multiplies 3 with the result from the previous step (2)
        factorial(4) multiplies 4 with the result from the previous step (6)
    factorial(5) multiplies 5 with the result from the previous step (24)
```


## Linear recursion and iteration 
[[Python]]

#recursive 
Linear Recursion and iteration in Programming are two ways to systematically solve a problem with programming 
#algorithms
- **Linear Recursion** is where a function calls it self in a sequence 
	- Grows linearly with the parameter of the function/Other words calls it self in a linear manner leading to a linear sequence of `recursive` calls
```JS
function factorialUsingRecursion(n) {
 if (n === 0) {
   return 1;
 } else {
   return n * factorialUsingRecursion(n - 1);
 }
}
console.log(factorialUsingRecursion(5)); // Outputs: 120
```

#iterative 
- **Linear iteration** on the other hand uses a loop until the condition of the program is met 
	- Running the same code until it does what it was instructed to do/ each process is independent from the other meaning they don't interfere with one another
```JS 
function factorialUsingIteration(n) {
 let res = 1;
 for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
   res *= i;
 }
 return res;
}
console.log(factorialUsingIteration(5)); // Outputs: 120
//In this example, the function `factorialUsingIteration` uses a `for` loop to multiply the current value of `res` by each number from 2 to `n`. This approach avoids the need for recursion and can often be more efficient for large inputs

```

- **Deffered Operations** AKA deffered Execution: is the execution of certain process in a program are put on hold until it is needed.  
- An example is *C#* where the function `yield` exists to do this operation for us. 

``` JS
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
   setTimeout(() => resolve("Promise resolved"), 1000);
});

// The code below won't run until the promise is resolved
promise.then(result => console.log(result)); // Outputs: "Promise resolved" after 1 second
```

- There is a `chain of Deffered Operations` where basically the same however its a **sequence of operations** that is put on hold until it is needed 
- Once it is executed the sequence starts 

#### State Variables 
These are variables that change over time throughout each process in the Linear Recursive process as well as the Linear Iteration Process 

`Linear rec`: They change and update as the function call itself each time 

`Linear Iter`: They change as the loop executes each time. 



One key thing to note is the the difference between Recursive/Iteration Function and the process it self 
- Function is specific to the one function where the process talks about a program doing the Recursive/Iteration to solve a problem
