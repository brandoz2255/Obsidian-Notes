Enhance my laptop as well as my desktop PC basically augmenting it with 

This is going to go hand in hand with the Personal Assistance need to make this applicable in windows which is why it would use electron to help make this possible
- to be used across platforms MacOS, Windows, Linux etc

[[the readme file]]

# Phase one
- Looks at and describes what its looking at via camera
- then waits for my gestures to do a pre-programmed tasks
- first volume up and down the volume with my fingers 
- second open obsidian, firefox,Terminal 
- third type with just gestures (might do this but sounds kinda cool)
- Analyze more than just people!! 
- Facial recognition  for sudo commands 
- GUI 

## Phase two
- NLP to listen to my commands in natural language
- Listening on commands wont be picky on how the user asks to open any application via voice but can ask if it didn't hear or understand instruction
- Applies reminders by giving a huge notification on screen 
- Allows to listen to the user to type something onto the application its using 
- Final stage of phase two is that it responds back to the user simple responses tho siri based shit yk 

### Phase three
- Allows Machine learning to give the user better ideas on how to ask/search something up on firefox/web browser 
- Can help with VS code via machine learning 
- Integrate ChatGPT API to allow for a more immersive conversation 
- Also with GPT API could integrate all of the previous shit with GPT alone
- Basically giving my laptop more life to it and almost sentientness

How to do test's [[tests]]
- Add helper files in your lib as well  [[lib]]

[[blueprint React]]

Electron changed now just for a site idea have phase available on a site and a react application will be the full product
## Questions that need answers

[[lib]]
- before I begin I need to have this structured what libraries 
- Flask will be used for Python for the usability in Electron (only if needed)
- Basic JS 
- cyberpunk theme black and blue 
- Choose a CSS framework 
- Choose a helping JS libary if need be 
-
