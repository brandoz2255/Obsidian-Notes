- Once we have information on our target we can use the Domain Name System which is an exellent place to look for this kind of information.

## What is DNS
- The DNS is the internets phone book which is of course descirbed by our original IT teacher
- Domains such as  hackthebox.com and inlanefreight.com allow people to access content on the iternet 
- The internet protocol which we know as the IP addresses are used to communicate between web browsers
- DNS converts domain names to IP addresses allowing browsers to access resources on the internet
- Each Internet connected device has a unique IP address that other machines use to locate it
- A DNS server minimizes the need for peoplee to learn the IP address lik `184.17.42.72` or of course a mire sophisticated modern alpanumeric IP address like` 2606:4700::6811:2b48 `in IPv6
- When a user types www.facebook.com into their web browser a translation must occur between what the user types and the IP address required to reach the facebook page
- The advantages of using DNS are the usage of allowing the sue of numbers to identify hosts
	- It also is alot easier to remember a name than it is to recall a number 
	- by merely retargetting a name to the new numeric address, a server can change numeric addresses without having to notify evryone on the internet
