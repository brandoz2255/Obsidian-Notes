## Everything on lInux is a file
- the directory hierachry you can always look it up but it said to look like an upside down tree
- / is the highest directory that you can travers to 
- however the dash in front of the directpryh is not the same as the / for the rootd
- /bin holds all of oyur programs known as binaries 
- /boot has everythign that your computer uses grub ram and the system stuff
- /home has all of the system users home directory+

## /boot
- files to the boot process 

## /dev
- Holds devices connected to the system 
- Block devices like hard drives 
- Null which 

## /etc
- Holds configuration files or system wide settings 
- etc/passwd or /etc/group -system 
- Your also always user 1000 when you are the first user
- etc/hostname -systemname 
- /etc/ssh -service configuration file 

## /run 
- stores runtime information 
- pockets Ids
- Sockets 
- Logs

## /sbin
- stands for system binaries 
- usualy uses during the early stages of a system boot 
- initializes the file system or network interface cards
- includes the binary used to power off a system

## /tmp
- Temporary directory where processes can create and share files 
- will periodically clean itself and edelte all content
- how it deletes it self is when the system powers off

## /usr
- A catch all directory for anything user related 
- /usr/bin `are executable programs `
- /usr/lib libraries used by binaries

## /var
- Stores system variable data:
- /var/log logs generated by the system 
- /var/tmp temporary filees that stay after a reboot 
- /var/www default location for web server files 

## /run 
- is the runtime data that process that starte ince the last boot 
- its usually in the var/run
- d
## /var




|Location|Purpose|
|:--|:--|
|`/boot`|Files to start the boot process.|
|`/dev`|Special device files that the system uses to access hardware.|
|`/etc`|System-specific configuration files.|
|`/home`|Home directory, where regular users store their data and configuration files.|
|`/root`|Home directory for the administrative superuser, `root`.|
|`/run`|Runtime data for processes that started since the last boot. This data includes process ID files and lock files. The contents of this directory are re-created on reboot. This directory consolidates the `/var/run` and `/var/lock` directories from earlier versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.|
|`/tmp`|A world-writable space for temporary files. Files that are not accessed, changed, or modified for 10 days are deleted from this directory automatically. The `/var/tmp` directory is also a temporary directory, in which files that are not accessed, changed, or modified in more than 30 days are deleted automatically.|
|`/usr`|Installed software, shared libraries, including files, and read-only program data. Significant subdirectories in the `/usr` directory include the following commands:<br><br>- `/usr/bin`: User commands<br>    <br>- `/usr/sbin`: System administration commands<br>    <br>- `/usr/local`: Locally customized software|
|`/var`|System-specific variable data should persist between boots. Files that dynamically change, such as databases, cache directories, log files, printer-spooled documents, and website content, might be found under `/var`.|


In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and later, four older directories in `/` have identical contents to their counterparts in `/usr`:

- `/bin` and `/usr/bin`
    
- `/sbin` and `/usr/sbin`
    
- `/lib` and `/usr/lib`
    
- `/lib64` and `/usr/lib64`
    

Earlier versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux had distinct directories with different sets of files. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and later, the directories in `/` are symbolic links to the matching directories in `/usr`.
