# Things to consider 
1. **Define the Purpose**: Clearly outline the goals and objectives of your chatbot. What topics will it cover? What age group will it cater to? What kind of questions will it answer? This will help you stay focused and create a more effective educational tool.

	2. Want it connected to the internet 
	3. Also want it to have acess to creating directories and saving files 
	4. Also what would be cool if we can do this is having it do an english thing such a write an essay in our personal style as in giv it our old essays used from the past for school 
    
2. **Choose a Platform**: There are several platforms available for building chatbots, such as Dialogflow, Microsoft Bot Framework, and Rasa. Some platforms are more beginner-friendly than others, so choose one that suits your current skill level. For educational purposes, you might want to consider a platform that allows for customization and has a strong community for support and learning.

3. **Design the Conversation Flow**: Before you start coding, design the conversation flow. This involves mapping out possible user inputs and the corresponding bot responses. This will serve as your blueprint and will help you structure your code better.

	2. asks prying  question to help it understand what i mean 
    
4. **Choose a Programming Language**: Depending on the platform you choose, you might need to use a specific programming language. For example, if you choose Dialogflow, you'll need to use JavaScript or Python. If you're not familiar with these languages, there are plenty of online resources where you can learn.

5. **Build and Train Your Chatbot**: Now it's time to build your chatbot. Use your conversation flow as a guide and start coding. Once you have a basic version, you'll need to train your chatbot by providing it with examples of user inputs and the correct responses.
    
6. **Test and Refine**: After training your chatbot, test it thoroughly. Check if it's responding correctly to user inputs and if the conversation flow is smooth. Make adjustments as necessary.
    
7. **Deploy and Monitor**: Once you're satisfied with your chatbot, deploy it on your chosen platform. Monitor its performance and make adjustments as necessary based on user feedback and usage data.
