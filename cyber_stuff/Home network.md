¡Vaya, tu amigo tiene talento! Setting up a home network infrastructure with Raspberry Pi devices is indeed a cool project. Here's a simplified guide on how you can achieve something similar:

**Materials:**

1. **Raspberry Pi devices (at least three):**
    
    - One for the password manager and container manager.
    - Another for the custom DNS server.
    - The third for the VPN and web graphical user interface.
2. **MicroSD cards for each Pi:**
    
    - These will store the operating system and your configurations.
3. **VPN Service:**
    
    - Choose a VPN service for secure remote access.

**Steps:**

1. **Set Up Password Manager and Container Manager:**
    
    - Install and configure a password manager (e.g., Bitwarden).
    - Set up container management software (e.g., Docker).
    - Optimize and manage containers for performance.
2. **Configure Firewall:**
    
    - Set up and configure a firewall on one of the Raspberry Pis.
    - Block malicious traffic and restrict unauthorized access.
3. **Custom DNS Server:**
    
    - Install and configure a DNS server (e.g., Pi-hole).
    - Customize DNS settings for faster resolution.
4. **VPN Configuration:**
    
    - Set up a VPN on one Raspberry Pi for secure remote access.
    - Ensure proper encryption and security protocols.
5. **Web GUI for Container Manager:**
    
    - Add a web graphical user interface for the container manager.
    - Host tools and operating systems accessible through an encrypted VPN tunnel.
6. **Network Integration:**
    
    - Connect the Raspberry Pis to your home network.
    - Ensure proper communication between devices.
7. **Domain Name:**
    
    - Consider getting a domain name for your home network (e.g., l3m0naid.tech).
8. **Documentation:**
    
    - Keep detailed documentation of your setup for future reference.

Remember to adapt these steps based on the specific technologies and tools your friend used. It's a hands-on project, so feel free to experiment and customize according to your preferences. ¡Buena suerte, Dulce! If you have any specific questions during the process, just let me know.
