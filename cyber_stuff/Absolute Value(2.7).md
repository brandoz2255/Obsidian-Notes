- What a absolute value is the representation of a  fixed point without regard to a direction or a sign

-  this for reference we actually have notes on this on the school weve made earlier

- here is a better representation of what the absolute value is essentially 
- here when x = a value it is representing both the negative and positive value of the integer given
- One important thing to remember when x < a value it is talking about the values between the value as we mentioned before **negative and positive** 

## Notation of absolute values

Lets look at the question its asking for the value of units within 4 units of 11 in absolute value terms its not x = 11 its asking **11-4 and 11+4** this is different than x=11

- In this asking its asking **x -4 and x +4 and x =11** in this context 

- The notation for writing values within a a certain amount of units like 4 units within 11 is 

$$7<x<15$$

- This is how we write that 11 - 4 and 11+4 d

- For the graph we can already see an example in which the middle is 11 and just move and down by 4 then plot it

This one on the other hand is an example of the greater than we instead of asking units within 16 its asking units away 16 but not just away at least away 

- The difference here is just its asking less than or equal to the value 16 as in 
$$x\le13 {or} x\ge19$$

### Another example of within statements

- In the statement of this question its asking for the values within 2.5 units of 6
- Like it states all values of x whose distance from 6 is less than 2.5

So we would graph it like this $$3.5<x<8.5$$
#### Another example

We would describe this situation as

- When it states no more than a value its telling you stop at 3 inches literally no more than that value

Note within in less than or equal is filled in dots and just less than is a spotted dot
