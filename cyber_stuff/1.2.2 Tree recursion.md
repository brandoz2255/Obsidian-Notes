A Tree recursion is a recursion process that calls itself multiple times each call leading to other recursive calls this is in contrast to the LInear recursive where it just does this once.

``` C++
#include <stdio.h>
void TreeRecursion(int n) {
   if (n > 0) {
       printf("%d\n", n);
       TreeRecursion(n - 1);
       TreeRecursion(n - 1);
   }
}
int main() {
   int x = 3; 
   TreeRecursion(x);
}

```

- Here is an example in C++ 

```JS 
function treeRecursion(n) {
   if (n > 0) {
       console.log(n);
       treeRecursion(n - 1);
       treeRecursion(n - 1);
   }
}

let x = 3; 
treeRecursion(x);
```

- Tree recursion is usually specifically for just functions however in a way this can be implemented in other ways as well 

#algorithms 

The cons of this Algorithm is the Space it uses to solve a problem or do a process and the time it would take to do the process it takes up a lot in both accounts. 

hurts the time complexity[aka order of growth] and space complexity 

## Orders of Growth 
This is also known as thee time complexity of a process in a program as in the time it takes to do the operations within a function and the time it takes for the function to work together with the other functions leading to the overall prefromance of the program.

- Think of it as the time it takes to do the operation in relation to the input that the program/function of an operations gets 
	- As in if the input gets larger will the program become slower[answer is yes but its our job to fix how slow]
- Also think of it as prediction of the time it takes to do said operation 
- Key for knowing how it works and knowing how to fix a slow bug or going to fast

Poorly managed Time complexity 
```JS 
function factorial(n) {
   if (n === 0) {
       return 1;
   } else {
       return n * factorial(n - 1);
   }
}
```

Well managed 
```JS 
let cache = {};

function factorial(n) {
   if (n === 0) {
       return 1;
   } else if (cache[n]) {
       return cache[n];
   } else {
       cache[n] = n * factorial(n - 1);
       return cache[n];
   }
}
```
