 # Testing for primality 

**Fermat test**: Is a probabilistic test that determines whether a number could be a probable prime which goes hand in hand with the theory 

**Fermat's little theorem**: This one is interesting basically its a trick in number theory in which p is a prime number for any integer `a` not divisible by `p` the remainder when `a^p` is divided by `p` is congruent to modulo `p`. 

- so in other words its p/a isn't possible then a^p divided p has a remainder of 1 meaning 1 modulo p

This is of course a theory of a algorithm the real deal usage comes in terms of cryptography #research 

```JS
function powerMod(base, exponent, modulus) {
    let result = 1;
    base = base % modulus;
    while (exponent > 0) {
        if (exponent % 2 === 1) {
            result = (result * base) % modulus;
        }
        exponent = exponent >> 1;
        base = (base * base) % modulus;
    }
    return result;
}

function isPrime(n, k) {
    if (n % 2 === 0 && n !== 2) {
        return false;
    }
    if (n <= 3) {
        return true;
    }
    while (k > 0) {
        const a = Math.floor(Math.random() * (n - 3)) + 2;
        if (powerMod(a, n - 1, n) !== 1) {
            return false;
        }
        k--;
    }
    return true;
}

```

## Formulating abstractions with higher order functions 

**Powerful Programming languages**: Basically the languages that include the block structure within them to have them structured and well used any language with a lot of libraries basically modern languages 

**Primitive Programming languages**: This was before the era of the block structure such as assembly or machine code. 

- ***Higher Order Function HOF***: A function that takes one or more functions at the same time or returns a functions and functions that manipulate functions. 

	- used to create more functional and reusable code 
	- example is the map function in JS

Simple example 

```JS 
// A higher-order function that takes a callback function as an argument
function higherOrderFunction(callback) {
    // Perform some operations
    // Call the callback function
    callback();
}

// A callback function that is passed to the higher-order function
function callbackFunction() {
    console.log("Callback function is executed.");
}

// Using the higher-order function
higherOrderFunction(callbackFunction);

```

Example of a higher-order Function 

```JS
function createMultiplier(factor) {
    return function (number) {
        return number * factor;
    };
}

const double = createMultiplier(2);
const triple = createMultiplier(3);

console.log(double(5)); // Outputs: 10
console.log(triple(5)); // Outputs: 15
```

In other words a function that uses other functions and returns said function basically

# Summation 
#math 
The idea of **summation** here is whats important in mathematics its the process of a function to find the total sum. In calculus it is said to be convergent and converges to some limit and when it does not it diverges.

- In programming here it can also be applied mathmatically however this is more straightforward
- On computing its is the sum of a sequence of evaluating a funtion over a set of inputs
numpy
```Python
def sum_series(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total += i
    return total

# Example usage:
print(sum_series(10)) # Output: 55

```

JS
```JS
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    sum += i;
}
console.log(sum); // Output: 55

```

### Finding the integral 
**Integral**: the integral is a continuous analog of sum which is used to calculate the areas, volumes, etc. Two different ways of doing this is integration and the one being differentiation. 

```Python
import scipy.integrate as spi
import numpy as np

# Define the function to integrate
def integrand(x):
    return 2 * x * np.exp(-x)

# Define the limits of integration
a = 1.0
b = 5.0

# Compute the integral using the Romberg method
result = spi.romberg(integrand, a, b)

print('Result is ', result)

```

#blockStructure 

**Lambda Expression**: user defined expressions basically a mini function that the coder can quckly make up auto save time or space. 

- ` Local Names` are basically the names of variables, functions or class that are defined within a specific scope such as block of code
- `Auxiliary Functions`  A function that supports a another function or operation so that it can be re-used across a program

```Python
def calculate_area(width, height):
    # 'width' and 'height' are local names within the scope of this function
    def square(value):
        # 'value' is a local name within the scope of the 'square' function
        return value ** 2
    
    # 'calculate_area' uses the auxiliary function 'square' to perform its task
    return square(width) * square(height)

# Call the main function with actual values
area = calculate_area(5, 3)
print(area) # Output: 15
```
