# Testing for primality 

**Fermat test**: Is a probablisitc test tht determines whether a number could be a probable prime which goes hand in hand with the theory 

**Fermat's little theorem**: This one is interesting basically its a trick in number theory in which p is a prime number for any integer `a` not divisible by `p` the remainder when `a^p` is divided by `p` is congruent to modulo `p`. 

- so in other words its p/a isn't possible then a^p divided p has a remainder of 1 meaning 1 modulo p

This is of course a theory of a algorithm the real deal usage comes in terms of cryptography #research 

```JS
function powerMod(base, exponent, modulus) {
    let result = 1;
    base = base % modulus;
    while (exponent > 0) {
        if (exponent % 2 === 1) {
            result = (result * base) % modulus;
        }
        exponent = exponent >> 1;
        base = (base * base) % modulus;
    }
    return result;
}

function isPrime(n, k) {
    if (n % 2 === 0 && n !== 2) {
        return false;
    }
    if (n <= 3) {
        return true;
    }
    while (k > 0) {
        const a = Math.floor(Math.random() * (n - 3)) + 2;
        if (powerMod(a, n - 1, n) !== 1) {
            return false;
        }
        k--;
    }
    return true;
}
