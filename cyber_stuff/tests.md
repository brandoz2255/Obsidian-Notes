1. **Unit Tests:** These tests focus on testing individual units or components of the software in isolation. Unit tests verify that each unit behaves as expected and meets its specifications. They are often automated and run frequently during the development process to catch regressions and ensure code quality.
    
2. **Integration Tests:** Integration tests verify interactions between different components or modules of the software. They ensure that the integrated system functions correctly as a whole and that individual components work together seamlessly. Integration tests may involve testing APIs, databases, external services, or communication between modules.
    
3. **End-to-End Tests:** End-to-end tests simulate real-world user scenarios and validate the entire workflow or user journey through the application. These tests cover multiple components and subsystems and verify that the software behaves as expected from the user's perspective. End-to-end tests help identify issues related to system integration, user interface, and overall functionality.
    
4. **Regression Tests:** Regression tests ensure that new changes or updates to the software do not introduce unintended side effects or break existing functionality. They validate that previously implemented features continue to work correctly after modifications or enhancements. Regression tests are essential for maintaining the stability and reliability of the software over time.
    
5. **Automated Tests:** Test suites often include automated tests that can be executed automatically without manual intervention. Automation helps streamline the testing process, improve efficiency, and ensure consistent test execution across different environments and configurations.
