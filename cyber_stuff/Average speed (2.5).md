$$m={\frac{{\triangle}y}{{\triangle}x}} = {\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}}$$

- This is also something needed when finding the average speed as in the constant rate of speed since this is the formula for cosntant rate of change example usage 

-  We could use this formula to find the constant rate of change (rate of speed)

- When we plug in the values into the formula we get 1.25 also imprtant to remember the format specifier miles per minute

- In this example we use the answer we got to get the next question since we have to find additional 7 minutes after the 29 miles mark we multiply the rate of change by new value 7 thats how we got 8.75 miles
