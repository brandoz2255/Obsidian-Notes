For C++, since you're comfortable with simpler CLI applications, here are a few project ideas:

1. Text Editor: Creating a text editor from scratch can be a great way to understand how text processing works in C++. You could start by supporting basic features like opening, editing, and saving files, and then gradually add more features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, etc.
    

2. Calculator: A calculator is a classic project for beginners. You could start by implementing basic arithmetic operations and then extend it to support more complex operations like trigonometric functions, square roots, etc.
    

Employee Management System: This is a more complex project that involves managing employee data. You could create a system that stores employee details, calculates salaries, handles attendance, etc. This project would give you a good understanding of how to manage data structures in C++[](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-7-cpp-project-ideas-for-beginners/)
