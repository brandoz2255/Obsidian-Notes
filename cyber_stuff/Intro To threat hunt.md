## Definition 
What a threat hunter is basically a person or a strategy when a hunter goes after a threat that avoids security measures or a threat that somehow went passed security measures 

- Basically this is a human detecting errors on when a security service  doesnt do its job on alertign the network there has been an intrusion from the attacker 
- Where a human manually looks at thee network or machine to see if there are any types of threats 

## Incident handeling 
This goes hand and hand with the steps of incident handling as mentioned before [[Incident Handling overview]] As you can tell it would go hand in hand

- Since the incident handling deals with handling an incident that has occurred in the system 
- How this is used in the threat hunt is instead of focusing on in case this happens its based on its actually happening and we must move to eradicate 

It is used proactively and re actively one key thing to keep in mind so in other words unlike just incident handling threat hunt involves both with making contingencies and dealing with the situation like batman

### When should we hunt 
- We should hunt when we are looking manually at our network security and machines and if notice something weird and out of the ordinary
