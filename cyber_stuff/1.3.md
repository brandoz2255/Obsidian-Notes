 # Shifts and stretches 

In calculus the general logic behind **`stretches`**  is when outside forces affect the function of the graph. When its a stretch we look at thew coefficient of the function bigger number, bigger stretch. 

- *`Shifts`* however are a little different  if the `coefficient` is inside the function its a left or right shift depending on the sign of the coefficient
#stretch
For example lets say we have a function called $f(x)$ and we have an outside force constant variable `a` then it would $af(x)$ meaning that the constant `a` is our `coefficient` that determines the **`stretch`** out side of our function. 

- when $a > 1$ is a **`stretch`** 
- when $0 < a < 1$  its a **`compression`**. 
#shifts
Now for the shifts for example the coefficient would have to be inside the function for example $af(x-h)$ here our coefficient is `h` this means that our function will have  a right shift.  

- when `h` is negative its a right shift $x-h$
- when `h` is positive its a left shift $x+h$
- To not get confused by this just solve for h then it would make sense why the output is the way it is for `h` 
	- In other words when we solve for `h` when its *`negative`* we get a positive output of `h`

# Composite Functions 

The term **Composite** in `composite functions` is the idea of **`composed of two`** or more other functions meaning that ***`composing functions`*** is just applying the `output of one` function *into* the `input of another`. 

- Lets say we have the function $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ and we get the term $f(g(x))/(f * g)$  it would be putting $g(x)$ into $f(x)$ 
- Or in other words the **`output`** of `g` into the input the `f`

## Symmetry 
This is when the graph is perfect symmetrical when crossed upon the y-axis having both sides the same 

- Even symmetry we can tell when the graph is $f(x)=f(-x)$ for all x in the functions domain when it crosses the y-axis
- Odd symmetry on the other hand is when $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all x we got the odd graph 

#### Interpretation 


### Inverse Function 

The inverse Function is the undo of a regular function when we take the inverse function it like hitting the undo button of the original function basically reversed. 

- for example the $f(x)$ the inverse is $f^-1(x)$ or vise versa taking the inverse is like funding the mathematical twin to our original function

#### Example 

1. Replace f(x) with y : $y = 2x+3$
2. swap x and y : $x= 2y+3$ 
3. then we solve for y: $2y = x-3$
4. $y = x-3/2$

then$$ f^-1(x) = x-3/2$$$


## How to interpret inverse

- One key thing to remember is that the *inverse function* is the undo button in math when the inverse is an **exponential** then the inverse of **doubling** would be **half-life**.
