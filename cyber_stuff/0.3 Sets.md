#sets
	A **Set** in Discrete mathematics is a collection of unordered/distinct objects also refereed to as elements or members

- sets in discrete math are typically denoted in Capital letters where elements within the sets are denoted in lowercase letters 
$$b ∈ B$$

- Is the standard notation of elements this is translated to indicate that an element `b` is part part of set `B` 

$A = {1, 2, 3}$ This is how   set would normally look like 

## Symbols 

- **(`∈`):** this symbol in discrete math is used to describe `is an element of` it expresses a certain value or variable that belongs to a specific set. 
 
$$a ∈ A$$

- **(`∉`):** This symbol represents the `not an element of` basically the opposite of the last one used to express a value or variable that doess not belong to a certain set. 

$$b ∉ B$$

- **`ℕ`** : In mathmatics natural numbers are the set of positive integers usually starting from 1 they are represented by the symbol **`ℕ`**  

$$N = {1, 2, 3, ...}$$

- **(`|`):** this one represents the such that symbol in which the set is based on certain conditions used to specify the condition. 

$${n | n > 5}$$

- Also used in **`:`** 

For example 

Let's consider three sets:

- A set of natural numbers `ℕ = {1, 2, 3, ...}`
- A set `A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`
- A set `B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}`

Now, we want to define a new set `G` that includes all natural numbers greater than 5. We can write this as:

***`G = {n ∈ ℕ | n > 5}`***

This reads as "`G` is the set of all `n` such that `n` is an element of `ℕ` and `n` is greater than 5."

Similarly, we can define a set `H` that includes all numbers that are in `A` but not in `B`:

***`H = {n ∈ A | n ∉ B}`***

This reads as "`H` is the set of all `n` such that `n` is an element of `A` and `n` is not an element of `B`" [1](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1946938/notation-for-set-excluding-element)[3](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~milos/courses/cs441/lectures/Class7.pdf)[4](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Combinatorics_and_Discrete_Mathematics/Applied_Discrete_Structures_(Doerr_and_Levasseur)/04%3A_More_on_Sets/4.02%3A_Laws_of_Set_Theory)[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)).

## Operations on sets 
- Opersation on sets in discrete math invlolves combining sets in various ways the main types are 

	- Union: these are two set such as A and B (usually denotees as `A ∪ B`) which **`is the set of elements which are in A ,In B or in both A and B`** `A = {1, 2, 3}` and `B = {3, 4, 5}`, then `A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`[1](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/discrete_mathematics/discrete_mathematics_sets.htm)
	- Interesction: the intersection of two sets such as A and B denoted as `A ∩ B` **`is the set of elements that are in both A and B`**.  `A = {1, 2, 3}` and `B = {3, 4, 5}`, then `A ∩ B = {3}` [1](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-sets.html)[5](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~milos/courses/cs441/lectures/Class7.pdf)
	- Difference: The difference between two sets A and B denoted as  `A - B` or `A \ B` which **`is the set of elements that are in A but not B`** 
	- Symmetric Difference: The symmetric difference of two sets A and B denoted as `A ⊕ B` **is the set of elements that are in A but not B. **
	- Cartesian Product: The Cartesian product of two sets A and B (denote by `A x B`) **`is the set of all ordered pairs in which a is the element of A and b is the element of B`**
