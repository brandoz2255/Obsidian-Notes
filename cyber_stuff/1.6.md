# Power Functions vs Exponentials

- **Power functions**: are the in which a  variable is raised to a fixed exponent that is multiplied by a constant $f(x) k*x^p$ where k is a constant multiplied by x to the power of p.

$$f(x) k*x^p$$

- **Exponential Functions**:  thse are functions that are a constatn base raised to a variable $f(x) = b^x$ 

## Polynomials 
Polynomials are functions in which power functions  are multiplied by each other for example f(x) = 3x^2 +3x +1 of course the powers can always be different 
- In other words they are the sums of power functions 

- what is important about Polynomials is finding the zeros that is when x = 0 which are essential to solving polynomials 
- methods of doing
