HTML One thing I remember from Smiths bootcamp was the definition of the markup language used for websites Hyper text markup Language 

- Straightaway this code already states that the langauge is used in  conjunction with CSS these two lanauges are basically married to eachother 
- since JS was made to make web dev easier a site doesn't need Js to do the backbone of a site however JS makes it run smoother and faster 

## Syntax basics 
When making the HTML document we must first define taht the file type is html using what html we would be using with the header of `<!DOCTYPE html>`  followed by `<html>` 

- There are two main sections in a html file the `<head>` and `<body>` The `head` is the section that contains the CSS design of the site
	- also contains information of the site 
- `Body` contains the actual shit that is display to the users in the site so we edit the css in the head and call upon that code in the body 

### HTML elements 
when  elements are defined in a site they must have a start tag and an end tag as in this syntax example `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`

- This is the html version of `print("this is a paragraph")` 

HTML has six headings in a site as the first is defined as `<h1>` the last is defined as `<h6>`  goes from most important to least important content of structure 

links are in the `<a>` thats how you can define a link 

### comments 
Html comments are design with this syntax as in `<!-- Comment goes here -->`
