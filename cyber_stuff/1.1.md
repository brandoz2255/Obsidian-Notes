- **Function**: A definition of a function in calculus is the relationship between two sets of real numbers typically referred to as the domain and range 

`Formal Definition` 

**Definition of a Function:** A function `f` from a set `A` to a set `B` is a rule or correspondence that assigns to each element `x` in `A` exactly one element `y` in `B`. The set A is called the domain of the function, and `B` is called the codomain./`range`

In notation, we write this as `f :Aâ†’B`, where `f(x)=y` for each `x` in `A`.

- Each *element* in the **domain** must be associated with the elements in the codomain/`Range` 
- Domain is the set of all inputs and codomain/`Range` the set of all outputs 
	- In other words codomain is range 

**Domain**: The set of all input values that the function can produce  aka independent variables 


$$Domain: ( A = \mathbb{R} ) (all real numbers)
$$

**Range**: The range on the other is all the output values that the function can produce  aka dependent variables 

$$Range: ( B = \{ y \in \mathbb{R} \mid y \geq 0 \} )$$

#### what isn't a function??

- Any input that gives out two outputs or more 
- ans any input that doesn't give out an output 

For example a vertical line ins't a function

## Linear Function 

A **linear function** is a functions that simply has a constant rate of change which forms a straight line when graphed 

- F(x) is the output of the function 
- x is the input 
- m is the slope of the line which is the rate of change of the function 
- b is the y intercep so just solve for y or b 

General Syntax

$$f(x)=mx+b$$


Finding the slope Formula:

$$[ m = \frac{{y_2 - y_1}}{{x_2 - x_1}} ]
$$

This we would find m which is the slope of the function 
- this would also be described as rise over run 

To find `y =mx+ b` we must solve for be in that formula and plug in our given `x1` value and `y1` value 


- Slope is key to calculus 

Point slope form 

$$[ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) ]
$$


- this is also the same when you solve for b just replace x with zero

## Parallel and Perpendicular  

- **Parallel Definition**:  Two lines that are parallel have the same slope `m` but different y-intercepts `b` same constant rate of change but never intersect 
	- If the slope of two lines are equal they are parallel 

$$[ y = 3x + 4 ]
[ y = 3x - 7 ]
$$

- **Perpendicular Definition**:  Two lines become perpendicular when they intersect at a right angle and form 90 degrees and the product of the slope is -1 
	-  If they are negative reciprocals of each other then they are perpendicular

$$[ y = 3x + 4 ]
[ y = 3x - 7 ]
$$

### Decreasing and increasing 
1. **Increasing Function:**
    
    - An increasing function is a mathematical relationship where as the input variable increases, the output variable also increases.
2. **Decreasing Function:**
    
    - A decreasing function is a mathematical relationship where as the input variable increases, the output variable decreases.
