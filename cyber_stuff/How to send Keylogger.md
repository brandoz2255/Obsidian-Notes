## Phishing
- How a hacker can send a keylogger malware to a system is essentially from various forms of attacks that a traditional malware would be sent:
- Such as The infamous Phishing emails Clicking a link or downloading an attachment from this email is generally how this kind of malware/spyware can be installed onto a machine
    - Other examples of phishing type strategy is an instant message or a social media post

## Trojan

- Another method is using a Trojan virus which is just disguising a download file as something legit when in reality its malware/spyware
- Trojans are linked to Phishing since one of the methods to give a trojan to a target is of course phishing.

## Zero -Day

- A zero day method is a way to get the keylogger onto the target however a zero day exploit is a bug that a hacker notices on early stages of a software release and the hacker exploits it

## Infected Website(Evil twin)

- The hacker could also have an infected website that essentially just has the spyware on or downloads it in the background once the person has visited the site.
- An Evil Twin on the other hand is creating a copy of a trusted source and just have it as infected website which how hackers can get information from someone working in a business.
