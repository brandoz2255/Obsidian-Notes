| **Goal**       | Write playbooks for larger, more complex plays and playbooks.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Objectives** | - Write sophisticated host patterns to efficiently select hosts for a play.<br>    <br>- Manage large playbooks by importing or including other playbooks or tasks from external files, either unconditionally or based on a conditional test. |
