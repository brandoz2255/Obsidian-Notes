sub domain enumeration using OSINT which means doing this in the passive manner 
- the first thing we would is clone teh repositroy of  sublist3r this tool was developed in python 
- so we are gonna download it using pip 3 install and python3 but first we clone repo
- we weould use the sublist tool we are gonna ignore the brute force tactics since we are doing this in the passive manner 
- this how use  the  tool it would all be in the sc we made 
- now within the tool we ciuld get5 how it is geting the subbdomains it goes throguh everyu other seaerch engine to list subomains 
- Basically sublister jsut goes through every search engine for th domain we specified to look for subdomains in the domain we wanted to look up 
- then sublister basically just displays the information in the destkopo in a file so we cat that file to look at the lists 

yea so basiucally just clone the github repository and install it with python then go through the set  up and  use the program then once in the program we can use it to look for subdomains passively we can do this by going through the man page and using the syntax 

- the cool thing ahbout it it uses every search engine available to find subdomains in the domain server and creates it into a list which we would then open and looka t all the different subdomains
