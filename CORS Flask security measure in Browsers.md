`CORS` (**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**) is a security mechanism implemented by web browsers to control access to resources (like APIs) from a different domain than the one serving the web page. In `Flask, CORS` support is typically added using the `Flask-CORS` extension to allow cross-origin requests.
