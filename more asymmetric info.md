In **asymmetric cryptography**, also known as *public-key cryptography*, each participant has a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key can be shared openly with anyone, while the private key is kept secret. The key characteristic of asymmetric cryptography is that data encrypted with one key can only be decrypted with the other key in the pair.

#### Key Points:

1. **Public Key**: Shared openly and used to encrypt data.
2. **Private Key**: Kept secret and used to decrypt data.
3. **One-Way Encryption**: Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key, and vice versa.
