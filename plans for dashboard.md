## Secure Microservices Application with Automated Security Testing

Build a microservices-based application with the following components:

1. Two Ubuntu machines: Deploy microservices using Docker and Kubernetes
2. Kali machine: Act as the security testing environment
3. Home PC (control node): Manage the entire infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline

## Project Components:

1. **Microservices Application:**
    
    - Develop a simple e-commerce application with 3-4 microservices (e.g., user service, product service, order service)
    - Use a modern framework like Spring Boot (Java) or FastAPI (Python)
    - Implement proper API security (authentication, authorization)
2. **Infrastructure as Code:**
    
    - Use Terraform to provision and manage your infrastructure
    - Implement Ansible for configuration management of your Ubuntu and Kali machines
3. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    
    - Utilize GitHub Actions for continuous integration
    - Implement FluxCD for GitOps-based continuous deployment
4. **Security Integration:**
    
    - Integrate SAST (Static Application Security Testing) using SonarQube
    - Implement DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) using OWASP ZAP
    - Use Trivy for container vulnerability scanning
    - Implement Secret Management using HashiCorp Vault        
5. **Monitoring and Logging:**
    
    - Set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
    - Implement ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging
6. **Automated Security Testing:**
    
    - Create custom security tests using Kali Linux tools
    - Automate these tests as part of your CI/CD pipeline

## Implementation Steps:

1. Set up your microservices application and containerize it using Docker
2. Create Kubernetes manifests for deploying your application
3. Implement Infrastructure as Code using Terraform and Ansible
4. Set up your GitHub Actions workflow for CI:
    - Build and test your application
    - Run SAST using SonarQube
    - Scan containers using Trivy
5. Implement FluxCD for GitOps-based deployments
6. Set up monitoring and logging infrastructure
7. Create automated security tests using Kali Linux tools
8. Integrate security tests into your CI/CD pipeline

This project demonstrates your ability to implement a comprehensive DevSecOps pipeline, showcasing skills in containerization, orchestration, IaC, CI/CD, security integration, and automated testing. It's a practical example of shifting security left in the development process, which is highly valued in the industry[1](https://devsecblueprint.com/projects/devsecops-home-lab/)[4](https://enhancv.com/resume-examples/devsecops-engineer/)[5](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1cspevc/setting_up_cyberdevsecops_homelab_advice/).
