`ansible-navigator` command is a command-line tool used to run and manage Ansible content. It works by using container-based automation execution environments to run Ansible Playbooks.


### How It Works

`ansible-navigator` relies on configuration files and various subcommands to execute and manage your Ansible automation.

- **Execution Environments**: Instead of running Ansible directly on your machine, `ansible-navigator` uses pre-built container images called automation execution environments. This ensures that your automation runs in a consistent and predictable environment. By default, it uses an image included with Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.
- **Configuration**: You can customize its behavior through an `ansible-navigator.yml` file. This file allows you to define settings such as the execution environment image to use, output modes, and whether to save playbook results.
- **Running Playbooks**: The most common use is running playbooks with the `ansible-navigator run` command. You can run it in standard output mode 

**Managing Ansible Content**: Beyond just running playbooks, the tool has other functions:

- `ansible-navigator inventory`: Verifies and displays managed hosts and groups from your inventory files.
- `ansible-navigator collections`: Lets you browse available Ansible Content Collections and their modules.
- `ansible-navigator config`: Shows your current Ansible configuration settings and where they come from.
- `ansible-navigator images`: Lists the execution environment images available on your system.
