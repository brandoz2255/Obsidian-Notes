**Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**

- A type of machine learning model inspired by the brain’s network of neurons.
- Consists of layers of _nodes_ (neurons) that transform input data into predictions.
- Commonly used for image recognition, natural language processing, and time‑series forecasting.

**How ANN Relates to Quantum Machine Learning (QML)**

- QML seeks to use quantum bits (qubits) to perform the same kind of transformations that ANN nodes do, but potentially faster or with fewer resources.
- Quantum circuits can encode data in superposition, allowing parallel evaluation of many ANN weight configurations.
- Hybrid models combine classical ANN layers with quantum layers to exploit both worlds.

### Quantum Computing in the Real World

- **AWS GPU/CPU Costs**
    
    - 13.6 k GPUs + 412 CPUs ≈ $50–60 k/month.
    - Shows the high cost of large‑scale ML training.
- **Chip Production**
    
    - TSMC & NVIDIA have production lines booked until 2030.
    - Only 15–30 % of chips are AI‑compatible; < 1 % for data‑center GPUs/TPUs.
    - 9 k companies rely on TSMC’s 3 nm process.
- **Supply‑Chain Vulnerabilities**
    
    - Without TSMC, 90 % of high‑end CPUs/GPUs cannot be made.
    - US data centers depend on these chips → pushes for domestic manufacturing.
    - Workforce shortages in the US are a major bottleneck.
