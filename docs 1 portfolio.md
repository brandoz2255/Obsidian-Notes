## 5. Debugging and Issue Resolution

### 5.1 Tailwind CSS Configuration

Several challenges were encountered with Tailwind CSS v4 configuration:

- **Issue**: Initial rendering errors related to CSS variables and class naming
- **Analysis**: Identified that Tailwind v4 uses a different configuration approach than previous versions
- **Solution**: Updated configuration to use `@import 'tailwindcss'` instead of directives, removed the tailwind.config.ts file, and defined CSS variables directly in globals.css
- **Learning**: Documented the differences between Tailwind v3 and v4 for future reference

### 5.2 Animation Synchronization

Challenges with animation timing and synchronization were addressed:

- **Issue**: Typing animation had duplicated characters and cursor positioning problems
- **Analysis**: Identified race conditions in the animation timing logic
- **Solution**: Implemented a module-level variable to track animation state and separated text and cursor elements
- **Optimization**: Added cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks

### 5.3 Mobile Layout Issues

Several mobile-specific layout issues were resolved:

- **Issue**: Content overflow and improper spacing on mobile devices
- **Analysis**: Identified inconsistent padding and container sizing
- **Solution**: Implemented the `useMobile` hook for conditional rendering and styling
