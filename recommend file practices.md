> **Goal:** Keep your secrets safe, your repo clean, and your team happy.  
> **Audience:** Community‑college students who just started using Ansible.

## 1. Naming Conventions

| What                   | Why                      | Example        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| **Use a clear prefix** | Quickly spot vault files | `vault_`       |
| **Add a purpose**      | Know what the file holds | `vault_db.yml` |
| **Keep it short**      | Easier to type           | `vault_db.yml` |
| **Avoid spaces**       | Shell‑friendly           | `vault_db.yml` |

**Mnemonic:** _P_refix + _P_urpose = _P_roper name.

## 2. File Location

| Where                           | Why                       | Tip                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Root of the repo**            | Easy to find              | `./vault_db.yml`              |
| **Separate vault folder**       | Keeps secrets isolated    | `./vaults/vault_db.yml`       |
| **Never in public directories** | Avoid accidental exposure | Do **not** put in `./public/` |

**Rule of thumb:** _If it’s not in a `vaults/` folder, it’s probably not a vault file._

---

## 3. File Permissions

| Setting        | What it does                      | Command                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `chmod 600`    | Owner can read/write, others none | `chmod 600 vault_db.yml`   |
| `chown <user>` | Ensure correct owner              | `chown $USER vault_db.yml` |

> **Why?** Even if the file is encrypted, you don’t want anyone else reading the encrypted blob.

---

## 4. Password Management

| Practice                      | Why                                      | Tool                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Use a password manager**    | Keeps passwords safe & shareable         | 1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden                   |
| **Never hard‑code passwords** | Avoids leaks in source control           | Store in manager, not in playbooks               |
| **Use `--ask-vault-pass`**    | Prompts each run                         | `ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass` |
| **Use `--vault-id`**          | Multiple vaults with different passwords | `--vault-id prod@vault_pass.txt`                 |

**Mnemonic:** _P_asswords _M_anage _S_ecurity.

## 5. Version Control

| Action                                        | Why                        | Command                                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Add to `.gitignore`**                       | Prevent accidental commits | `echo "vault_*.yml" >> .gitignore`                 |
| **Use `git update-index --assume-unchanged`** | Temporarily ignore changes | `git update-index --assume-unchanged vault_db.yml` |
| **Commit only when needed**                   | Keeps history clean        | `git commit -m "Add vault file"`                   |

> **Tip:** If you _must_ commit a vault file, make sure the repo is private and the file is encrypted.

## 6. Encryption Best Practices

| Practice                        | Why                        | Command                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Use AES256**                  | Strongest default          | `ansible-vault create --vault-id prod@vault_pass.txt vault_db.yml` |
| **Avoid large files**           | Decryption slows playbooks | Keep secrets < 1 MB                                                |
| **Rekey after password change** | Keeps data secure          | `ansible-vault rekey vault_db.yml`                                 |

**Mnemonic:** _A_ES _S_ecure _L_arge _R_ekey.

## 7. Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall                                | Fix                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Forgot to encrypt**                  | `ansible-vault encrypt file.yml`            |
| **Wrong password**                     | `ansible-vault edit file.yml` (re‑enter)    |
| **Storing in public repo**             | Move to private repo or add to `.gitignore` |
| **Using same password for all vaults** | Use `--vault-id` to separate them           |

---

## 8. Quick Reference Checklist

1. **Name** → `vault_<purpose>.yml`
2. **Location** → `./vaults/` or root
3. **Permissions** → `chmod 600`
4. **Password** → Manager + `--ask-vault-pass`
5. **Git** → `.gitignore` + `assume-unchanged`
6. **Encrypt** → AES256, small size
7. **Rekey** → After password change

> **Remember:** _Vault files are your secret vaults—treat them like you would a real lockbox._

the recemmended file practices for var file management 

simply it makes ense to set up the ansible project so taht sensitive vars and all other vars are kept in serperate files 


sicne that managing group vars  and host vars is to create directories at the playbook level group_vars dorectory normally contain vars files within the namems that mathch the host group to which they apply host_vars dirtectory normally 

ou can use subdirectories within the `group_vars` or `host_vars` directories for each host group or managed host. T

In the following example project directory for the `playbook.yml` playbook, members of the `webservers` host group use variables in the `group_vars/webservers/vars` file. The

`demo.example.com` host uses the variables in both the `host_vars/demo.example.com/vars` and `host_vars/demo.example.com/vault` files.:


```bash
.
├── ansible.cfg
├── group_vars
│   └── webservers
│       └── vars
├── host_vars
│   └── demo.example.com
│       ├── vars
│       └── vault
├── inventory
└── playbook.yml
```

If you do create subdirectories for each host group or managed host, most variables for `demo.example.com` can be placed in the `vars` file, but sensitive variables can be kept secret by placing them in the `vault` file. You can use `ansible-vault` to encrypt the `vault` file and leave the `vars` file as plain text.


You can name files in the `host_vars/demo.example.com` any valid file name you choose. The file names used in the `host_vars/demo.example.com` directory are examples only; they have no special significance. That directory could contain more files, some that are encrypted by Ansible Vault, and some that are not.

Playbook variables (as opposed to inventory variables) can also be protected with Ansible Vault. You can place sensitive playbook variables in a separate file that is encrypted with Ansible Vault, then include that encrypted variables file in a playbook by using a `vars_files` directive. This can be useful, because playbook variables take precedence over inventory variables.

If you are using multiple Vault passwords with your playbook, make sure that each encrypted file is assigned a Vault ID, and that you enter the matching password with that Vault ID when running the playbook. This ensures that the correct password is selected first when decrypting the vault-encrypted file, which is faster than forcing Ansible to try each of the Vault passwords that you provided until it finds the right one.
