[[Assement Standards]]

Vulnerablility assessment is important since every organization must have to perform many different types of security assements 

- Security  Assessments 
- Networks 
- Computers 
- Applications

Primary purpose is to find important and confirm vulnerabilities. 

- Different ways and methodologies of how secure a computer is 

**Vulnerability assessments**: is a assesment on all organations and networks must go through which is based on a particular security standard. 

**Penetrations test**: is a simulated cyber attack to determine if a network is vulnerable 

- **Black box** Pen testing | is done with no knowledge of the network configs and apps 
- conducted in order to see a what if an external attacker would attack 
- **Grey box** pen testing | is done with only little bit of knowledge when they are testing 
- **White box** pent testing | is done by giving the tester full access to all systems configs and build documents
- **Application** pen testing | asses the web applications like bug bounties they will often look at source cod mess around with apis etc 
- Network/Infrastructure pen testers | asses all of the aspects of a networks inlcuding the netwokr devices like 
	- Firewalls 
	- workstations
	- servers
	- applications 
	- must have a strong understanding of 
	- windows 
	- Linux 
- pen tester always specialize in a particular area 

- Network Vulnerablilities such as `Nessus` acn be used alongside other tools with networking pen testing
- 

- On the othe hand **Physical pen tester** leverage securityu weaknesses and breakdown proceeeses in a facility
- Social engineering pen tester hack people 
	- Can you open a door in an unintended way?
	- Can you tailgate someone into the data center?
	- Can you crawl through a vent?

- Pen testing is for medium and high security maturity level 
- `CSIRT` (`computer security incident response team`)
- `CISO` (`chief information security officer`)
- `CTO` (`chief technical officer`)


`Vulnerability assessments` and pen testing are two different things 

- it makes sure that it up to security standards such as GDPR compilance or OWASP web standards
