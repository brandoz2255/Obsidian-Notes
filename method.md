[[Incident Handling overview]]
### SIEM

**SIEM(Security Information and Event Management)** systems collect and analyze data from various sources, such as **system logs**, **network traffic logs**, **authentication logs**, etc., to detect and respond to security incidents.


### **Summary of the General Incident Response Steps:**

1. **Preparation** – Get ready with plans, tools, and training.
2. **Identification** – Detect the incident and confirm it.
3. **Containment** – Limit the damage and prevent further spread.
4. **Eradication** – Remove the threat and clean the environment.
5. **Recovery** – Restore systems and monitor for reinfection.
6. **Lessons Learned** – Review and improve the process for next time.

### **1. Preparation**

**Goal:** Ensure your organization is ready to respond to incidents. This is the foundational step where you prepare everything in advance.

- **Actions:**
    - Develop and maintain an **incident response plan**.
    - Set up the necessary **tools** (SIEM, IDS/IPS, endpoint security tools).
    - Establish **communication protocols** (who to contact and how).
    - **Train** employees and incident response teams on what to do during an incident.
    - Ensure **backups** and recovery procedures are in place.

**Why it's important:** Preparation ensures your team is **ready to react quickly** when an incident occurs, minimizing damage and recovery time.

### **2. Identification**

**Goal:** Detect and recognize that an incident has occurred.

- **Actions:**
    - Monitor and review **logs**, alerts, and anomalies from SIEMs, IDS, firewalls, etc.
    - Validate if a security event is an actual **incident** (e.g., potential malware infection, data exfiltration, unauthorized access).
    - **Classify the incident** (e.g., malware, DDoS, insider threat, etc.).
    - Document the **indicators of compromise (IoCs)** such as malicious IPs, files, or user behavior patterns.

**Why it's important:** Proper identification ensures you can **respond promptly** and avoid missing important signs of compromise or attack.

### **3. Containment**

**Goal:** Limit the scope and impact of the incident while maintaining business continuity as much as possible.

- **Actions:**
    - **Short-term containment:** For immediate action, like **isolating infected machines** or **blocking malicious IPs** to stop the attack from spreading.
    - **Long-term containment:** Implement measures to keep the threat from spreading further while continuing to investigate (e.g., disabling compromised accounts or restricting network segments).

**Why it's important:** **Containment** helps to prevent further damage and **keeps the attacker from escalating** or spreading to other parts of the network.


---

### **4. Eradication**

**Goal:** Remove the root cause of the incident to ensure it doesn’t happen again.

- **Actions:**
    - **Eliminate** any malware, backdoors, or tools the attacker left behind.
    - **Remove** any unauthorized accounts or changes made by the attacker.
    - **Patch vulnerabilities** that allowed the attack to happen in the first place.
    - **Re-image systems** if needed to ensure they are clean.

**Why it's important:** If you don’t fully **eradicate** the threat, it could return or be reactivated, potentially causing further damage.


---

### **5. Recovery**

**Goal:** Restore affected systems and return to normal operations while closely monitoring for signs of reinfection or escalation.

- **Actions:**
    - **Restore systems** from clean backups.
    - **Re-enable systems** and services that were previously shut down or isolated.
    - **Monitor** systems and network closely for any unusual activity.
    - Ensure systems are fully patched and secured after restoration.

**Why it's important:** Recovery focuses on getting the system back to its **normal state**, while ensuring there’s no ongoing threat.


----

### **6. Lessons Learned**

**Goal:** Review the incident to identify what went well and what could be improved for future responses.

- **Actions:**
    - **Conduct a post-incident review** (also known as a **"retrospective"** or **"after-action review"**).
    - Identify what was **successful** in the response and what **could be improved**.
    - Update incident response plans, detection rules, and defenses based on **lessons learned**.
    - Provide **training** based on the insights from the incident.
    - Share findings and improvements with the broader organization, if necessary.

**Why it's important:** **Lessons learned** help strengthen your security posture and ensure that **future incidents** are handled more efficiently and effectively.

### Malware 

- **Detection & Analysis:** Use **Splunk** to analyze logs (DNS traffic, file integrity, etc.) and identify IoCs.
- **Containment:** Isolate infected systems to prevent spread.
- **Eradication:** Remove malware by cleaning or reimaging the system.
- **Recovery:** Restore affected systems from backups and monitor for reinfection.
- **Lessons Learned:** Review logs and update security policies.
