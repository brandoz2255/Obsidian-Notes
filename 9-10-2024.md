# Mean Value Theorem (MVT) and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC)

# Mean Value Theorem (MVT) and GeoGebra Usage

## Concept

The Mean Value Theorem (MVT) states that for a continuous and differentiable function f(x) over an interval [a,b]:

There exists a point c where the tangent line's slope equals the secant line's slope:


$(F(b)−F(a))/(b−a) = F′(c)$



## GeoGebra Usage

In GeoGebra, you can set up the MVT using the Solve command to find c where the theorem holds:

```rust
Solve((F(b) - F(a)) = F'(c) * (b - a))
```



Example:  $Solve(F(1.301) - F(1.3) = f(x) * 0.001)$ calculates a numerical solution using specific values for b-a.

## Interpretation

The graph shows the curve $F(x)$ and a secant line connecting $F(a)$ and $F(b)$. The tangent line at c has the same slope as this secant line, confirming the MVT.

# Using GeoGebra for Riemann Sum Approximation

## Concept

Riemann sums are used to approximate the area under a curve. The general formula for a Riemann sum is:

$\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(c_i) \cdot \frac{b - a}{n}$




As n→∞, the sum converges to the exact integral $\int_a^b f(x) \, dx$.

## GeoGebra Usage

Use the Summation function in GeoGebra to compute Riemann sums:



``` Python
Sum(f(c_i) * (b - a) / n, i, 1, n)
```



Adjust $n$ to increase the number of rectangles for better approximation.

**Visualization**: GeoGebra will plot the rectangles used in the Riemann sum approximation. As n increases, the approximation becomes more accurate, visually matching the curve.

## Interpretation

The graph shows the rectangles under the curve, representing the approximate area. As the number of intervals increases, the rectangles fit the curve more closely, demonstrating the convergence of the Riemann sum to the integral.

# Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) and GeoGebra Integration

## Concept

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connects differentiation and integration. It states that:

$$\begin{equation}\int\limits_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)\end{equation}$$

where F(x) is the antiderivative of f(x) such that F′(x) = f(x).

## GeoGebra Usage

You can compute definite integrals using GeoGebra's Integral function:

``` C
Integral(f, a, b)
```



Example: $Integral(sqrt(x), 0, 2)$ calculates the area under $sqrt(x)$ from 0 to 2.

## Interpretation

GeoGebra shades the area under the curve corresponding to the integral value. The visual interpretation helps confirm the value of the integral as the area between the curve and the x-axis.

# Solving for Antiderivatives with GeoGebra

## Concept

Finding antiderivatives is a key aspect of integration. Given a function f(x), its antiderivative F(x) satisfies F′(x) = f(x).

## GeoGebra Usage

Use GeoGebra's Derivative and Integral commands to solve for antiderivatives and verify the results:

``` C
Integral(f(x), x) 
//finds the indefinite integral of f(x)

Derivative(F(x), x) 
// finds the derivative of F(x), verifying it matches f(x)
```


Example: For $f(x) = x^2$, use $Integral(x^2)$ to get $1/3 x^3$. Then, use $Derivative(1/3 x^3)$ to confirm it matches $x^2$.

## Interpretation

GeoGebra will plot both the function and its antiderivative, providing a visual representation of how the derivative and integral relate to each other.

# Polynomial Integration Example in GeoGebra

## Example

Given $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 2x + 9$, compute the definite integral from -1 to 2.

Command: $Integral(x^3 - 3x^2 - 2x + 9, -1, 2)$

Result: GeoGebra will shade the region under the curve and return the value of the integral, which can be verified manually:

$$\begin{equation}\int\limits_{-1}^{2} (x^3-3x^2-2x+9) \, dx = \frac{75}{4}\end{equation}$$

## Interpretation

The shaded area corresponds to the integral, and the result is displayed as the exact value of the area under the curve.

# Using GeoGebra to Apply MVT in Numerical Problems

## Concept

To verify the MVT numerically, you can use GeoGebra to solve for the value of c that satisfies the theorem.

## GeoGebra Usage

Command: $Solve(F(b) - F(a) = F'(c) * (b - a))$

Input specific values for a and b and find the corresponding c.

Example: If $F(x) = 2^x + 1$, find c in the interval $[1,2]$ such that:

``` Rust
F(2) - F(1) / 2 - 1 = F'(c)
```





GeoGebra solves for c numerically, showing how the MVT holds for specific functions and intervals.

## Interpretation

The graphical representation highlights where the tangent line at c is parallel to the secant line connecting F(a) and F(b). This confirms the existence of c as guaranteed by the MVT.
