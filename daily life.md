#### **Daily Routine Outline:**

**Morning Block (Gym + Quick Study Time)**

- **Gym**: Hit the gym early (5:00 AM wake-up, gym at 6:00). You get your hour and a half in, and then you have time left for some quick study/hw work after.
- **Quick Study/Review Block**: After the gym, review your hardest subject (Calculus or Physics) or finish any urgent homework before starting your commute. This way, you’re chipping away at it without feeling the crunch later.

#### **Core Study & HW Blocks (Broken by Subject)**

**Math/Physics Block (HW + Study)**

- Focus here on your **Assembly**, **Data Structures**, **Calculus 2**, and **Physics**.
- Spend time finishing HW and reviewing class notes. Prioritize this early because it's foundational, and once you’re done, it’s a huge mental relief.

---

**Coding Projects/CS Block**

- **Next.js** (Portfolio)
- **Python (Web Scraper)**
- **Rust (Binary Analyzer)**
- **C++ (Labs)**  
    You can rotate through these projects to avoid burnout on any one language. For example, work on Python one day, Rust the next. Be flexible, but aim for consistent progress.

---

#### **Cybersecurity & Docker Block**

**Cybersecurity Practice/Competitions Block**

- Do **Hack The Box**, **CCDC**, and **CPTC** practice during this block.
- Continue Docker work here as well, whether it’s your Docker project or additional Docker-related learning.

---

#### **Reading & Documentation Block**

**Reading & Documentation Block**

- Spend time reading SICP, class docs, or anything relevant to the projects you’re working on. This can be shorter but consistent, like 30 minutes to an hour daily, or more during weekends. Just enough to keep learning!

---

#### **Physical Rest/Recovery Block (V-Taper Goals)**

**Physical Rest/Recovery Block**

- Outside of your gym time, focus on recovery, stretching, or short walks to keep the blood flowing. Maybe mix in some mobility work if you want to enhance your V-taper.

---

#### **General Study Block (Flex Block)**

**Flex Block (Homework Overflow/Extra Focus)**

- Use this block for overflow if any of your subjects need extra focus that day or week. Could also be used to review for exams or study additional GE courses you want to finish up.
