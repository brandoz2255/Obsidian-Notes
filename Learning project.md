Custom project scaffolding tool: Develop a CLI application that generates project structures based on user-defined configurations[1](https://practice.course.rs/elegant-code-base.html). This will teach you about working with file systems, parsing configuration files, and creating templates.

### Core Concepts

1. **File System Operations**
    - Creating and manipulating directory structures
    - Handling file creation and copying
    - Managing path resolution across platforms
    - Understanding file permissions and access control
2. **Template Processing**
    - Variable substitution in templates
    - Dynamic content generation
    - Template inheritance and composition
    - Error handling in template rendering
3. **Configuration Management**
    - Parsing different configuration formats (JSON, YAML, TOML)
    - Merging configuration sources
    - Validating configuration data
    - Managing defaults and overrides

The diagram illustrates the three main layers of our scaffolding tool:

1. **Input Layer**: Handles both command-line arguments and configuration files, providing flexibility in how users specify their requirements.
2. **Core Processing**: Contains the business logic where configurations are parsed, templates are processed, and generation plans are created.
3. **Output Layer**: Manages the actual file system operations and creates the final project structure.

Each arrow represents data flow, showing how information transforms from raw inputs into a generated project. For example, CLI arguments and configuration settings are first combined by the Config Parser, then used by the Template Engine to prepare the actual files, before being passed to the Generator for creation.


### Essential Libraries

Based on this architecture, here are the key libraries you'll need:

1. **CLI Parsing**
- `clap`: Industry standard for CLI argument parsing [med](https://medium.com/better-programming/building-cli-apps-in-rust-what-you-should-consider-99cdcc67710c)

- [medium.com](https://medium.com/better-programming/building-cli-apps-in-rust-what-you-should-consider-99cdcc67710c)
- Alternative: `argh` for simpler interfaces
