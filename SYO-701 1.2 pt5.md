# Physical security 


### Security Measures

**Bollards:**

- Description: Sturdy posts installed at strategic points to prevent vehicular access or intrusion. Effective in protecting facilities from potential threats such as ramming attacks.

**Access Control Vestibules:**

- Description: Entry points equipped with advanced door systems designed to prevent tailgating and unauthorized entry. These systems might include mantraps or double-door systems that ensure that only verified individuals can enter secure areas.

**Fencing:**

- Description: Perimeter barriers set up to delineate property boundaries and deter unauthorized entry. Typically used to enhance visibility of intruders and serve as a psychological deterrent.

**Video Surveillance:**

- Description: Camera systems strategically placed to monitor and record activities within and around a facility. Helps in deterrence and provides evidence for investigation of suspicious activities.

**Security Guards:**

- Description: Personnel trained to monitor, respond, and manage security operations at physical locations. Guards are crucial for enforcing property rules and responding to emergencies.

**Access Badges:**

- Description: Badges that provide authenticated access to specific areas within an organization. These are part of an electronic access control system that logs entries and exits.

**Lighting:**

- Description: Illumination systems, such as floodlights or spotlights, that enhance visibility during nighttime or in low-light conditions to prevent unauthorized access or activities.

**Visitors Logs:**

- Description: Records that track the entry and exit of visitors to ensure all individuals can be accounted for. This system is often integrated with access badges to monitor and control visitor movements within a facility.

**Sensor Technologies:**

- Description: Devices deployed to detect unauthorized activity or intrusions within a designated area.
    - **Infrared Sensors:** Detect changes in heat levels, often used to identify the presence of individuals in restricted areas.
    - **Pressure Sensors:** Measure changes in pressure on the ground or floor, used for securing fences or under carpets.
    - **Microwave Sensors:** Emit microwaves and analyze the reflection pattern to detect movement.
    - **Ultrasonic Sensors:** Use high-frequency sound waves to detect motion or changes in the surroundings.

### Deception and Disruption Tactics

**Darknets** : *is a series of IP addresses that  were desinged not to be used but to be monitored for any suspicious activities. AKA Dark IP Addresses.* 

- used in the broader network of an organization to detect unauthorized access or any other related cyber-attacks. 

- **DNS Sinkhole**: *A DNS server designed  to return false IP addresses for certain hostnames.*
	- This technique is commonly used to redirect malicious traffic (e.g., traffic generated by botnets) to a non-existent or controlled IP address, effectively neutralizing the threat.

**Honeypot:**

- Description: *A decoy system or network set up to attract cyber attackers.* `The honeypot mimics real systems and can provide insights into attack strategies and tools used by hackers.`

**Honeynet:**

- Description: *A network of honeypots that simulates a larger, realistic network environment to engage attackers more deeply and study their behavior over a broader scope.*

**Honeyfile:**

- Description: *A decoy file placed within a network to lure attackers. When accessed, it triggers alerts that indicate a breach, helping to detect unauthorized access within the network.*

**Honeytokens:**

- Description: *Decoy data or tokens embedded within files or databases. They act like traps that, when interacted with, signal an alert to administrators about a possible security breach.*

**Fake Information:**

- Description: *False data or decoy websites created to mislead attackers or track their activities. This can help in identifying the attackersâ€™ locations or intentions by analyzing their interactions with the fake assets.*
