Kinematic Quantities in one dimension 

- this lecture introduces displacement, velocity, and acceleration as the primary quantities in motion in one dimension 
- **Displacement** ($\vec{r}$): Describes an objects change in position its a vector quantity means direction matters 
- **Velocity** $\vec{v}$ is the rate of change of displacement over time
- **Acceleration** $\vec{a}$  the rate of change of velocity it indicates how quickly an objects velocity is changing.

**Setting Up a Coordinate System**:

- The lecture explains that a proper coordinate system involves an origin at $O$ and a defined axis (usually the x-axis) where positive and negative directions can be measured.
- Positive x-values: represents motion to the right of the origin, while negative x values represent motion to the left 
- Key takeaway establishing a clear origin in the direction of the origin while negative x-values represent motion to the left

3. **Direction of Motion (Based on Velocity and Acceleration)**:
    
    - When $v>0$, the object is moving to the right. When $v<0$, the object moves to the left.
        
    - Similarly, $a>0$ means acceleration is in the same direction as the velocity (speeding up), while $a<0$ means the object is decelerating.
        
    
    > **Key takeaway**: The signs of velocity and acceleration provide insight into whether an object is speeding up or slowing down, and in which direction.

4. **Position vs. Time Graphs**:
    
    - The slope of the position vs. time graph provides **velocity**.
        
    - A **positive slope** means the object is moving forward, while a **negative slope** means it's moving backward.
        
    - **Constant slope** indicates constant velocity, i.e., no acceleration.
        
    
    > **Key takeaway**: Graphs are a powerful visual tool to understand motion. The steeper the slope, the faster the object is moving.

### Literature Notes for **Displacement and Velocity**

1. **Displacement**:
    - Defined as the difference between the final and initial positions:

$$\Delta \vec{r} = \vec{r}_f - \vec{r}_iÎ”r$$
