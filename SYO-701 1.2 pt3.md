# GAP 

- **`GAP Analysis`** : Essentially the process of making sure the digital security is up to industry standards and noticing the `gaps` in poor state of security 

- **`Assessment`** :  A procedure to understand the oranization's current security measures and policies 

- **`Benchmarking`** : Comparing the existing security practices with industry best standards 
	- **Risk Management**: helping organizations identify, assess, and prioritize risks 
		- It involves comparing an organization's current security practices and policies against industry standards or benchmarks to identify areas for improvement [1](https://www.comptia.jp/pdf/Security%2B%20SY0-501%20Exam%20Objectives.pdf).
	- **Security Governance**: ensure that security policies and practices remain effective and aligned with industry standards and regulatory requirements [1](https://www.comptia.jp/pdf/Security%2B%20SY0-501%20Exam%20Objectives.pdf).

- **`Identification`**: Gaps where the security measures fall short  
	- distinguishing between different types of security threats, attacks, and vulnerabilities.
	- **Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities**: This involves understanding the common methods used by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities and the indicators they might leave behind [1](https://www.comptia.org/faq/security/what-is-on-the-comptia-security-exam)[2](https://www.comptia.org/faq/security/what-is-comptia-security-certification).

- **`Prioritization`** :  cleaning the most important security risks
	- determining the most critical security issues that need to be addressed first
	- **Risk Management**: It involves identifying and prioritizing the most critical security gaps that need to be addressed to mitigate risks effectively [1](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/globalassets/documents/comptia-security-sy0-701-exam-objectives-5-0-1.pdf).
	- **Security Controls and Policies**: This includes understanding the importance of aligning security controls with business needs and regulatory requirements [1](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/globalassets/documents/comptia-security-sy0-701-exam-objectives-5-0-1.pdf).
	- **Vulnerability Management**: how to use tools and methodologies to assess vulnerabilities and prioritize them based on their potential impact and the ease of exploitation [1](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/globalassets/documents/comptia-security-sy0-701-exam-objectives-5-0-1.pdf).

- **`Remediation Strategy`** : Make a plan to close the "Gaps" in security 
	- This involves identifying the specific measures and steps required to rectify security issues
	- **Incident Response**: isolating affected systems, containing the incident, eradicating the threat, and recovering systems to a secure state [1](https://www.comptia.org/training/books/security-sy0-701-study-guide).
	- **Risk Management** It involves understanding how to implement measures to mitigate identified risks and prevent future incidents [1](https://www.comptia.org/training/books/security-sy0-701-study-guide).
	- **Security Controls and Policies**: Understanding how to implement and maintain security controls and policies as part of a remediation strategy is important.
		- This includes understanding the importance of regular reviews and updates to security policies and controls to address evolving threats [1](https://www.comptia.org/training/books/security-sy0-701-study-guide).
