suggestions:

- **Custom Snort wrapper:**
    
    - Develop a Python-based IDS using libraries like Scapy for packet analysis.
    - Alternatively, create a Python wrapper for Snort to automate its functionality and capture its output.

- **AI Dashboard for Incident Response:**
    
    - Build a Next.js front-end interface for visualizing IDS alerts and AI-driven insights.
    - Integrate stable AI models (e.g., Hugging Face's transformers) to analyze IDS outputs and provide actionable insights.

- **Microservice Architecture:**
    
    - IDS/Snort Wrapper Service (Python)
    - AI Analysis Service (Python with ML libraries)
    - Dashboard Service (Next.js)
    - Alert Management Service (Python/FastAPI)

- **DevOps Infrastructure:**
    
    - Use Vagrant and Ruby for VM orchestration
    - Implement Ansible for configuration management
    - Containerize services with Docker
    - Orchestrate with Kubernetes (one pod per VM)
    - Set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring

1. **CI/CD:**
    
    - Implement GitHub Actions for continuous integration
    - Use FluxCD for GitOps-based deployment

Implementation Steps: 
1. Develop the core IDS or Snort wrapper in Python.
2. Create AI models for analyzing IDS outputs (use pre-trained models and fine-tune them).
3. Build the Next.js dashboard for visualizing alerts and AI insights.
4. Containerize each microservice.
5. Set up Kubernetes cluster across your VMs.
6. Implement CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and FluxCD.
7. Configure Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
8. Develop and integrate automated security tests using your Kali Linux VM.
