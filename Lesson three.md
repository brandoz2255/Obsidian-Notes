we can make a future equations easier to use if we rewrite  Coulombs Law in a somewhat more complicated way

lets define a new constant, called the permittivity constant 

THen rewriting coulombs law in  terms of `e` gives us 


$$formula$$

Vectors from physics 

I hate and J hat formula for physics that would be added to the A and B thingy 

When two oppositely charged particles are a distance, r, apart they each experiance an attractive force 

formula here

in SI units 
$$ k=8.99x10^9 n m&2/c^2 $$
