## Control types

### Preventive Control Types

Stopping attackers from even seeing seeing our systems to prevent unauthorized access to our data. 

- **Access Control:** like a bouncer at a club entrance, making sure only the right people get in; Access controls mechanism include things like 
	-  User Authentication systems like passwords bio metrics etc 
	- [ACLs] Access control lists, and Role based access control [RBAC]
- **Firewalls**: Its like the gatekeepers of the network monitoring incoming and outgoing network traffic. Firewalls use rules to determine which traffic is allowed and which is blocked,
	- helping  to prevent unauthorized access or malicious attacks  
- **Encryption**: Encrypting data is like a no brainier in Cybersecurity. Encryption scrambles the data into a unreadable format ensuring that even if its intercepted it remains protected from prying eyes
	- Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption #research 

- **Patching and Updating**: Keeping your software up date is crucial step ahead of attackers. Patching Involves applying updates that fixes vulnerabilities. 

- **Security Awareness Training**: Users can be first line of defense notifying them of security is helpful especially with social engineering.  

# deterrent control types

#PhysicalControls 

`Deterrent Controls` the scarecrows of cybersecurity basically warding off potential attackers.  These control systems are all about scaring attackers within our systems or dissuading would be intruders. 

- **Warning Banners:** These are like "Fuck Off" signs plastered acrosss your system and networks.
	- warning banners to inform users and potential attackers that unauthorized access is prohibited and will reslut in legal action 

- **Security Guards (Physical Presence):**  Just like having a security guard patrolling the premises this is more on the `Physical Control` category but goes hand in hand with deterrent. 

- **Fending and Barriers:** Also more on the `Physical Control` side having literal physical fences and barriers

- **Security Cameras**: The eyes that never blink scouting the premises.  

# Detective Controls 
Always on the look out for signs of trouble these control are all about detecting suspicious activity and potential security incidents so they can be investigated and addressed promptly.

- **Log analysis**: analyzing the events and documenting what goes on analyzing  this data from servers, firewalls, and Intrusion detection Systems
	- Logs keep "logs" one every event that goes on in said process
	- Understanding how to interpret log data and identify signs of unauthorized access or malicious activity is essential.

- **Intrusion Detection Systems** (IDS): Basically Digital watchdogs scanning the network traffic for signs of suspicious behavior similar to a firewall. 
	-  Difference is that they aren't limited to just monitoring the network 

- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems**: These are like the command centers for Cybersecurity essentially aggregating and collecting data form various security tools and devices. Provide real time centralized platform for monitoring, altering, and monitoring security events

- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**: FIM tools monitor changes to files made int eh system config, alerting admins about the unauthorized modifications or tampering made to the systems. 

- **Anomaly Detection**: this provides techniques involved to identify deviations from normal behavior based on statistical analysis or machine learning algorithms
	- analyzing patterns of user and system activity for suspicious activities

# Corrective Control types
These Control Types are security measures designed to address and mitigate the  impact of security incidents or breaches. These are implemented after `an incident has been detected and is used to mitigate the damage or control the situation in order to restore normal operations`

- **Purpose**: Corrective Controls are designed to restore normal operations after an incident to minimize damage and prevent future incidents.
2. Types of corrective controls: 
	- **Recovery**:  This involves restoring systems and data to their normal state after an incident has occurred 
		- such actions are system backups
		- data recovery
		- restoring from backups
3. What to document: 
	- After an incidnet conduct a post incident review to understand what went wrong how we could stop this from happening again 
	- documenting the incident discovering the root cause and implementing changes

Corrective controls are essential in the recovery phase of security management to help restore normal operations after an incident. 

**Exam Tips**: For the Security+ exam, focus on understanding the purpose and types of corrective controls. Be prepared to explain how organizations can restore normal operations after an incident and how they can learn from incidents to improve their security measures.  #research 

# Compensating Controls
General Overview: These are the security risk that are designed to mitigate the risks associated with a particular vulnerability in a system. 
- Basically mitigating the risks if a incident were to occur

- **Purpose**:  They are designed to provide an additional layer of security that can help mitigate the impact of a security breach
- Types of Compensating Controls: 
	- **Dual Controls**: This involves having two separate controls in place for a single function like having two different passwords for a critical system
	- **Redundancy**: Implement redundant Systems or controls to ensure that if one fails the other can take over. like a backup server
	- **Monitoring and alerting:** Implementing systems to monitor for unusual activity and alert security personal if threats are detected. 
- **Security management**: Compensating Controls are important because they provide an additional layer of security that can help mitigate the impact of a security breach. 

**Exam Tips**: For the Security+ exam, focus on understanding the purpose and types of compensating controls. Be prepared to explain how organizations can implement compensating controls to provide an additional layer of security and how they complement primary security controls.

# Directive Controls 
General Overview: its a security control that involves the use of policies, procedures, and guidelines that manage and control access to information and resources within that organization. 

- **Purpose**: Directive Controls are designed to establish the rules and guidelines that would govern how information and resources are accessed and used within the organization

- ***Types of Directive Controls***: 
	- **Policies**: These are the statements that define the rules and guidelines for how information and resources should be managed and protected 
	- **Procedures**: These are detailed instructions that outline the steps to be taken to implement policies  
	- **Guidelines**: These provide recommendations or best practices for implementing the procedures

- **Importance in Security Management**: Directive controls are foundational to the security management process. They provide the framework within which security measures are implemented and managed.

**Exam Tips**: For the Security+ exam, focus on understanding the purpose and types of directive controls. Be prepared to explain how organizations use policies, procedures, and guidelines to manage and control access to information and resources. Also, be aware of the importance of directive controls in establishing the foundation for an organization's security management process.
