## Why Use Helm?

Kubernetes applications often involve multiple `YAML` files for different resources. Managing these files manually can become tedious and error-prone as the application grows in complexity. Helm addresses these challenges by:

- **Streamlining Deployments**: You can install or update an application with just one command.
- **Reducing Complexity**: Bundles all necessary configurations into a single chart.
- **Improving Consistency**: Ensures similar configurations across environments (e.g., `dev`/staging/production).
- **Saving Time**: Automates repetitive tasks like updates and rollbacks.

## How Does Helm Work?

1. **Helm Charts**:
    
    - A chart is a collection of `YAML` templates and metadata that define all the `Kubernetes` resources needed for an application.
    - Example: A chart might include templates for a Deployment, Service, and `ConfigMap`.
2. **Releases**:
    
    - When you install a chart, Helm creates a "release," which is an instance of the chart applied to your cluster.
    - Each release is versioned, making it easy to track changes or revert to previous states.
3. **Customization**:
    
    - You can customize charts using `values.yaml`, which allows you to override default settings without modifying the chart itself.

## Example Use Case

Suppose you want to deploy a web application with multiple components (frontend, backend, database). Without Helm:

- You would need to write separate YAML files for each component.
- Applying updates would require manually editing and reapplying these files.
