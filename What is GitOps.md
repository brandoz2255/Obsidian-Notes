`GitOps` is a modern way to manage infrastructure and application deployments by using Git as the single source of truth. It builds on Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- Integrates with DevOps Practices like CI/CD pipelines 

## Key Principles of GitOps:

1. **Declarative Configuration**: The desired state of infrastructure and applications is defined using declarative configuration files stored in Git repositories[1](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-gitops)[2](https://www.opsmx.com/what-is-gitops/)[4](https://spot.io/resources/gitops/understanding-gitops-principles-workflows-deployment-types/).
2. **Git as Source of Truth**: All changes to infrastructure and applications are tracked in Git, providing version control, auditability, and collaboration[3](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-gitops-workflow)[5](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/gitops)[7](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/gitops.html).


## Benefits of GitOps:

- **Improved Reliability**: Automation reduces human error and ensures environments remain consistent.
- **Auditability**: Every change is logged in Git, making it easy to track who made changes and when.
- **Developer-Centric**: Developers can manage infrastructure using familiar tools like Git, enhancing productivity[6](https://codefresh.io/learn/gitops/)[8](https://www.cloudbees.com/gitops/what-is-gitops).
- **Faster Deployments**: CI/CD pipelines automate deployment processes, reducing time-to-market for applications[3](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-gitops-workflow)[9](https://www.gitops.tech).
