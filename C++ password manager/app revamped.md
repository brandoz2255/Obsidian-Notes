# Goals 
Main goal is to have what we have made previously but this time have proper coding structure to avoid bugs and have proper test and version control to ensure its stability. 


## back end goals
- Generates Passwords 
	-  use a preferred  algorithm in the industry 
- Generates Usernames Both random and Both off of user input
	-  Also use a preferred algorithm in the industry
