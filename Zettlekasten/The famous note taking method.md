- This is one of the most interesting note taking method Ive heard by far Im going to dive deeper into this rabbit hole 
 
## Fleeting notes 
- Essentially the process comes from the idea of pure note interaction where the first step of the notetaking process is writing out quick reminders to the topic we are reading or viewing which is called fleeting notes 

# Permanent Notes 
- Then when its done we move on to step two the permant notes 
- this works in which after the fleeting process is complete you turn those notes into fully fledge easy to understand notes like easy in the way to remember without context and you do this purely off of your fleeting notes 

## Literature notes
- The third part wasn't explained in the article we read called [Obdidian.Rocks](https://obsidian.rocks/getting-started-with-zettelkasten-in-obsidian/) 
- But we can take this from our mentor Christian 
- he explains in which the literature aspect comes after the permanent notes which is just basically rince and repeat but for the same subject coming from a different trusted source
- Like lets say we are doing math we can notes on the video or lecture provided to us with the fleeting notes as reminders to the subject we just watched or read 
- then we move on to phase two Turn them into more polished good looking notes purely off of the fleet notes 
- Then we look a youtube on the same subject the lecture provides take fleeting notes on that and making them permanent 
- Then the literature aspect comes from using the two permant notes we made we would essentially combine the information form the lecture and the youtube video into one permanant note then connecting all of them together
