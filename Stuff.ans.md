This question is asking you to analyze an acceleration vs. force graph to determine the masses of two objects (A and C) based on the known mass of object B, which is given as 0.20 kg.

Here’s the reasoning you’ll need to apply:

1. **Newton's Second Law** states that F=maF = maF=ma, where:
    
    - FFF is the force,
    - mmm is the mass,
    - aaa is the acceleration.
    
    Rearranging this, you get a=Fma = \frac{F}{m}a=mF​, meaning that for a given force, the acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass. Objects with smaller masses will experience greater accelerations for the same force.
    
2. **Interpreting the Graph (Figure EX5.8):**
    
    - The graph shows acceleration (y-axis) plotted against force (x-axis).
    - For a given force, the slope of the acceleration vs. force graph corresponds to the inverse of the mass, i.e., a steeper slope means a smaller mass because a=Fma = \frac{F}{m}a=mF​.
3. **Given Information:**
    
    - You know that the mass of object B is 0.20 kg.
    - By comparing the slopes of the lines for objects A, B, and C, you can figure out the relative masses of objects A and C.

### Steps to solve:

- First, observe that object B has a certain slope, which you know corresponds to 0.20 kg.
- The object with the steeper slope (A) has a smaller mass than B because it accelerates more for the same force.
- The object with the shallower slope (C) has a larger mass than B because it accelerates less for the same force.

By comparing the slopes of the lines for objects A and C to the slope of object B, you can calculate their masses relative to B.
