## What is Helm?

Helm is a **package manager for `Kubernetes`** that simplifies the deployment, management, and configuration of applications in a `Kubernetes` cluster. It works by using **Helm Charts**, which are reusable templates that define `Kubernetes` resources (like Deployments, Services, `ConfigMaps`, etc.) required for an application.

Think of Helm as being similar to package managers like `apt` for Linux or `npm` for `Node.js`, but specifically designed for `Kubernetes`. It automates the process of deploying and managing applications, making it easier to handle complex configurations.

## Key Features of Helm

1. **Simplifies Deployments**:
    
    - Instead of manually writing and applying multiple YAML files, Helm bundles them into a single chart   
    - A single command can deploy an entire application.

2. **Versioning and Rollbacks**:
    
    - Helm tracks the versions of your deployments, allowing you to roll back to a previous version if something goes wrong.
3. **`Parameterization`**:
    
    - Helm uses a `templating` system (`values.yaml`) to customize deployments for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
4. **Dependency Management**:
    
    - Helm can manage dependencies between applications or services within your cluster.
5. **Reusability**:
    
    - Helm Charts are reusable and shareable, enabling teams to standardize deployments.
