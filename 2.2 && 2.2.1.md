# Hierarchal data

**Hierarchal Data structures/Data:** Refers to how data it-self and data structures are organized

- They are generally organized in a tree-like manner, where each node has a parent  node minus the root node.  [1](https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computer_Science/Programming_and_Computation_Fundamentals/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs_(Abelson_Sussman_and_Sussman)/02%3A_Building_Abstractions_with_Data/2.02%3A_New_Page) 
- Think of it as the tree graph problems in Discrete mathmatics! 
- Examples of hierarchical data structures include `binary trees, B-trees, and XML documents`.
- The hierarchy allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data, as relationships between data items are clearly defined.

# Closure Property

It is the ability to have the data structures nested within data structures themselves. 
-  For example a list of  list is an example of the `Closure Property` 
- Thus enables  the creation of hierarchal data structures 

### Relation to Closure Property

The closure property is essential for creating hierarchical data structures because it allows for the nesting of elements within elements of the same type.

### Importance in Computer Science

The ability to create hierarchical data structures with the closure property is crucial in computer science for several reasons:

- **Efficient Data Representation**: Hierarchical structures allow for compact and efficient storage of data, as relationships between data items are implicitly defined by their positions in the hierarchy.
- **Algorithm Design**: Many algorithms operate on hierarchical data structures, benefiting from the efficiency and logical organization provided by these structures.
- **Abstraction and Modularity**: Hierarchical data structures support high-level abstractions and modularity, making it easier to develop complex software systems.

# Box and Pointer notation! 

**Box and Pointer Notation:** is a way in which we can visually map out how variables and objects interact in memory during the execution of a program. 

### What is Box and Pointer Notation?

- Imagine you have a bunch of boxes (`variables`), and some of these boxes can hold pointers (`references`) to other boxes.
- Each box might contain a number, text, or even another set of boxes inside it. 

### Why is it Called Box and Pointer Notation?

- The term "box" represents a variable or an object in memory, holding either a value or a reference to another object.
- The "pointer" part is a reference from one box to another, showing how they are connected. 
- So, the notation is called "box and pointer" because it uses boxes to represent objects and pointers to show connections between them.

### Simple Example

Let's say you have three boxes labeled `x`, `y`, and `z`. Initially, `x` holds the number 48. Then, you decide to make `z` point to whatever `x` is pointing to. Now, `z` is also 48. Later, you create a new box `p1` that holds a point with coordinates (100, 150). If `x` now points to `p1`, the diagram would show `x` pointing to `p1`, and `z` still pointing to `x`, so indirectly to `p1` as well.

## Sequences 

In programming a sequence is like a recipe or a set of directions. 

- like when you are baking a cake you must do it in a specific order in order for the cake to turn out right
- Just like with given directions you must follow the set of directions correctly in order to arrive to your destination [2](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computer-science/sequences-selections-and-loops/1/#)
### Simple Example

Let's say you want to print the numbers from 1 to 10. The sequence in this case would be:

1. Start a loop that goes from 1 to 10.
2. Inside the loop, print the current number.
3. Move to the next number.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach 10.

# Programming structures 

This all falls into simple basic programming structures such as the  big three `Sequences`,`Selections`, and `Loops` 

- **Sequences**: as mention before its the series od steps that completed to finish the routine
- **Selections**:  A selection is based on the control flows statements such as if else statements if you don't have this then you do  must do  this else if you do then move on. 
- **Loops**: This is what controls how many times the sequence annd selection steps are done until the task is complete [2](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computer-science/sequences-selections-and-loops/1/#)
# Box notatiion and List notation 

**Box Notation**: box notation is how to visualize the data that is stored in the computers  memory. (refer to how Dr. Quon showed use how data is managed in C++) , any variable or object you create is a box that holds memory for the data. 

**List Notation:** Similar to box but instead of variables and objects we are focusing on the collection of variables and objects and data stored in a list like a `list` in python or an `array/vector` in C++
