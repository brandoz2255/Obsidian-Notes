## Key Takeaways for Future Projects

1. **Use the new import syntax for Tailwind CSS v4:**

```css
@import 'tailwindcss';
```

**Create a proper PostCSS configuration:**

```js
export default {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
  },
}
```

**Consider using direct CSS variables and classes for complex styling:**

- This reduces dependency on Tailwind's configuration
- Makes styling more explicit and easier to debug
- Provides more control over specific styling needs



**Avoid using the `@config` directive without proper PostCSS configuration:**

- The `@config` directive requires the `from` option in PostCSS
- For simpler projects, you may not need the `@config` directive at all



**Use `.mjs` extension for PostCSS config to ensure it's treated as an ES module**

By following these guidelines, you can successfully use Tailwind CSS v4 with Next.js while avoiding configuration errors.By following these guidelines, you can successfully use Tailwind CSS v4 with Next.js while avoiding configuration errors.
