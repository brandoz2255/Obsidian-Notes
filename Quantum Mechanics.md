$$i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = H \psi$$

This equation is the heart of Quantum Mechanics. It describes how a quantum system changes over time.

### Key Concepts:

- Wave Function (Ïˆ): A mathematical description of a quantum system
- Hamiltonian (H): Represents the total energy of the system
- Superposition: A system can exist in multiple states simultaneously
- Entanglement: Connected systems that affect each other instantaneously
- Uncertainty Principle: Certain properties (e.g., position and momentum) cannot be precisely known at the same time
