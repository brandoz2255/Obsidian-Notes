Fleet notes

- `Vulnerability Assessment` ther is a little to no manual exploitation it just to check if there are issues and steps to fix it

- vulnerablities can be commonly found thruough MITRE's [Common Vulnerability Exposure database](https://cve.mitre.org/) 
- and [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator) score

- **Exploit** any code that can be used to be taken advantage of 
- **Threat** is a process that amplifies the potential of an adverse event 
- **Risk** is the possiblity of asset being harmed 


To differentiate the three, we can think of it as follows:

- `Risk`: something bad that could happen
- `Threat`: something bad that is happening
- `Vulnerabilities`: weaknesses that could lead to a threat

**asset inventory** is a a critical component of vulnerablity management

- All data is stored in  **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)** 
- but there are also consumer services such as 
- `Google Drive`
- `Dropbox`
- `MiSoftware-as-a-Service (SaaS)crosoft Teams`
- `Apple iCloud`
- `Adobe Creative Suite`
- `Microsoft Office 365`
- `Google Docs`
- and the list goes on.
