Artificial Intelligence: is a field of computer science focused on creating systems and machines that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning from experience, making decisions, understanding language, recognizing patterns, and adapting to new situations[1](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence)[2](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence)[3](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-artificial-intelligence)[4](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-intelligence).


For a technical audience, AI can be described as:

- **The simulation of human intelligence by machines**, especially computer systems, through processes such as learning (acquiring information and rules for using it), reasoning (using rules to reach conclusions), and self-correction[1](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence)[2](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-intelligence).

- **A set of technologies**: that enable computers to process data, recognize speech, analyze images, translate languages, and make recommendations at a scale and speed beyond human capability[1](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence)[2](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-artificial-intelligence).

- involving computer science, statistics, data analytics, neuroscience, linguistics, and more[1](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence)

AI systems are typically built using techniques like **machine learning** (where algorithms improve through experience and data), **deep learning** (using neural networks with many layers), and **natural language processing** (enabling machines to understand and generate human language)[1](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence)[2](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence)[3](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-artificial-intelligence).


Such as:

- Virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa)
- Image and speech recognition
- Autonomous vehicles
- Recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon)
- Robotics and automation[1](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20200827STO85804/what-is-artificial-intelligence-and-how-is-it-used)
