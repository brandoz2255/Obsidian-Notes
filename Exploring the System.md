How commands generally work in the Linux Command line follows this syntax structure 

```bash
command -options arguments 
```


**ls** : stands for list is the most common command to use just lists the files within the directory you currently in 

- there are many flags I mostly use **-a** option which is *all* lists every single file in that directory 

- File page 16 
- 17 less 
	- Why its name how it’s used could it be better than cat and bat command 

- File system on page 20 good refesher 

- Pg 21 and 22 are syslinks and symbolic links important definitions what are they why are they important?
