Imagine you're ordering tacos for a party. O(1) is like having a taco bar ready to serve everyone at once—super quick, doesn't matter how many guests. O(n) is making a taco for each person one by one—not bad. O(n log n) is like organizing the guests into a fast-moving line with several taco stations. O(n^2) means every guest customizes a taco for every other guest—chaos! And O(2^n) or O(n!) is like every possible combination of toppings being tried out—it's a taco nightmare. To remember, think of which taco situation you'd want at your party—the efficient O(n log n) or the wild O(n!).
