- just like the hacking process the Blue team SOC side has their own  process

- Similarly to the Cyber kill chain this is called the incident handling process 
- It only consists of four steps which is what is mentioned in the picture 
## Overview of the process
- The handlers take most of their time in the first two steps of the Incident handling overview 

**Preparation and Dectection**:
- Just like the step in life when everything goes to shit this is when we focus on our system(ourselves) and looking for the next malicious event.

**Contianment Eradication**:
- This is the event that comes after we focus on our system and better it
- such as the picture indicate we contain the incident or fix it and t hen recover from the damage 

**Post-Incident Activity**: 
- This is just what happens after continuing the process we normally would and then restart the cylce of the incident handling

### Investigating and recovering
We must make sure that our attacker dosn't know that we have discovered them since this can be destrictive as you can imagine

- Discover the initial 'patient zero' victim and create an (ongoing if still active) incident timeline
- Determine what tools and malware the adversary used
- Document the compromised systems and what the adversary has done

### Last part
- After this we must plan a recovery and notify the staff that they can continue the business as normal 
- Lastly we must make a lesson learned report to make sure this exploitation doesn't happen again
