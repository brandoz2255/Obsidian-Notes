The GUI in the MacOs as mention before is the almost the same as the GUI in the iPhone here are some important key take aways and differences

|**Component**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Apple Menu`|This is our main point of reference for critical host operations such as System Settings, locking our screen, shutting down the host, etc.|
|`Finder`|Finder is the component of macOS that provides the Desktop experience and File management functions within the OS.|
|`Spotlight`|Spotlight serves as a helper of sorts on your system. It can search the filesystem and your iCloud, perform mathematical conversions, and more.|
|`Dock`|The Dock at the bottom of your screen, by default, acts as the holder for any apps you frequently use and where your currently open apps will appear.|
|`Launchpad`|This is the application menu where you can search for and launch applications.|
|`Control Center`|Control Center is where we can manage our network settings, sound and display options, notification, and more at a glance.|

- the Apple menu, FInder and Dock aren not on the the iPhone
- the Dock essentailly  is the same thing as the Dash in the gnome desktop in most Linux distros 
- Actually whats scary is how similar the MacOS desktop is with the Gnome Desktop
- The Control Center is essentially the same as it is designed in the iPhone GUI 

# Launchpad
- However what makes the MacOS powerful is the Launchpad which can literally go through the entire system to find any thing we want with ease
- Any thing can be found with ease from applications to files and secret files can be found in the GUI alot 
- The thing about the MacOS is the powerful GUI with an easy to use and the powerful CLI with the ease of use as well which this a good competitor with Windows and most Linux distros
