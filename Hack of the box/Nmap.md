* **Nmap** also known as Network Mapper
* basic Scan: suppose that in order ot perform a basic scan against a target [10.129.42.253] 
* We would essentially input [nmap 10.129.42.253]
* This would complete the scan quickly this would be because if we don't specify any additional option Nmap will scan only the 1000 most common ports by default 
* **By default Nmap will conduct a [[TCP]] scan unless its specified otherwise
* Port specifies what port it is and what its using 
* state heading confirms that these ports are opened or closed 
* service tells us that the service's name is typically mapped to the specific port number 
* The default scan will not tell us what is listening on that port until we of courses instruct Nmap to interact with the service
* port [3389] commonly means the device is a windows
* To do a more specified Nmap scan input[ -sC] parameter to specify Nmaps scripts should be used to try and obtain more detailed info
* [-sV] parameter instructs Nmap to perform a version scan. this scan Nmap will fingerprint services on the target system and identify the service protocol
* [-p-]tells Nmap that we want to scan all the TCP ports

The Syntax for running the Nmap Script 
* Nmap Scripts are a great way to enhance our scans functionality and inspection of the available options
* [[Network Enumeration]] can be done with Nmap
* Nmap can be used to get banners such as using Â `nmap -sV --script=banner <target>`
* We could also use `nmap -sV --script=banner -p21 10.10.10.0/24`mm 
[[FTP ]]
* FTP is a standard protocol, and this service can often contain interesting data. A Nmap scan on the port default for FTP is vsftpd 3.0.3
