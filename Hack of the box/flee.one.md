the` which` command is pretty easy to get use to when you want to find the path to a specific you jsut type `which python` or what ever the name of the program you are looking for and it will give you the path to said file
## Using the find command 
-  `find` this command is something we really  haven't gotten used to yet 
- The over all use of this tool is to well duhh find stuff it has the ability to find files and folders but the tool is more usefull when it is used to filter its results 
- the oevrall syntax


```Shell-session
find <location> <options>
```

- Reading the man pages will be so helpful however this command is really complicated example 

```shell-session
00818@htb[/htb]$ find / -type f -name *.conf -user root -size +20k -newermt 2020-03-03 -exec ls -al {} \; 2>/dev/null

- See what i mean what the fuck 
- anyways this can be very useful 

|**Option**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`-type f`|Hereby, we define the type of the searched object. In this case, '`f`' stands for '`file`'.|
|`-name *.conf`|With '`-name`', we indicate the name of the file we are looking for. The asterisk (`*`) stands for 'all' files with the '`.conf`' extension.|
|`-user root`|This option filters all files whose owner is the root user.|
|`-size +20k`|We can then filter all the located files and specify that we only want to see the files that are larger than 20 KiB.|
|`-newermt 2020-03-03`|With this option, we set the date. Only files newer than the specified date will be presented.|
|`-exec ls -al {} \;`|This option executes the specified command, using the curly brackets as placeholders for each result. The backslash escapes the next character from being interpreted by the shell because otherwise, the semicolon would terminate the command and not reach the redirection.|
|`2>/dev/null`|This is a `STDERR` redirection to the '`null device`', which we will come back to in the next section. This redirection ensures that no errors are displayed in the terminal. This redirection must `not` be an option of the 'find' command.|

- This is definitely usefull 
- the `locate` command offers a quick way to search through the system however when in contrast to the find command it works within the local database that contains all information about existing files and folders
- example 

```shell-session
00818@htb[/htb]$ locate *.conf

/etc/GeoIP.conf
/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
/etc/UPower/UPower.conf
/etc/adduser.conf
<SNIP>
```
