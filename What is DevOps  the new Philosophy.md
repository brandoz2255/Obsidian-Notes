### Cycle time

- the basic assumption about software development  
- Based off of the algorithm that kept pilots alive in the sky during a dogfight 
- OODA  (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop
- Must start with observing  busiiness market needs current user behavior  and available telemetry data 
- once analyzed we make a plan of attack of the solutions we can deliver off of the recon we just did 
- we should also include experiments with tessting out new technologies and methodologies

We recommend you use data to inform what   to do in  your next cycle 
- There has been evidence that one thrid of deployments have business results 
- Approximately one-third will have positive results
- and one-third will make no difference. 
- approach is called pivot or persevere.

##  Strive for Validated learning 

- How quickly one can fail is determined by the cycle 
- meaning how long it takes or how lean it is 
- cycle time determines how quickly you can gather feedback
