### **Week 1: Python Basics and Introduction to Automation**

- **Objective**: Teach the core Python skills needed for automation.
- **Theory**: Cover basic syntax, variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Introduce the concept of automation and how Python can help simplify tasks.
- **Hands-On**: Simple exercises like printing "Hello, World!" and organizing files based on extensions in a directory. This will set the groundwork for the file organizer project later.

### **Week 2: File Organizer with Python**

- **Objective**: Automate file handling tasks.
- **Theory**: Introduce libraries like `os` and `shutil` for interacting with the file system. Discuss the benefits of automating file organization.
- **Hands-On**: Build a Python script to sort files into folders based on file type (e.g., all PDFs into one folder, all images into another). This is a fun project that they can use for their own messy desktops!

### **Week 3: Web Scraping with Python**

- **Objective**: Automate data extraction from websites.
- **Theory**: Teach web scraping with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. Explain when scraping is useful, and discuss ethical scraping.
- **Hands-On**: Have them write a script to scrape a website for data like news headlines or product prices. Store the results in a file (e.g., CSV or JSON).

### **Week 4: Task Scheduling and Automation**

- **Objective**: Introduce task scheduling to make automation hands-free.
- **Theory**: Show how Python can schedule tasks using the `schedule` library, and explain how cron jobs work for regular execution of tasks.
- **Hands-On**: Write a Python script that runs at specific intervals (e.g., every hour) to perform tasks like cleaning up files or scraping websites. Set it up to run automatically using `schedule` or by creating a cron job.

### **Week 5: Final Project â€“ Put It All Together**

- **Objective**: Combine file organizing, web scraping, and task scheduling into one automation suite.
- **Project**: Build a Python automation script that:
    - Organizes files based on file type.
    - Scrapes a website daily for specific data (e.g., headlines).
    - Schedules these tasks to run automatically at a set time.
