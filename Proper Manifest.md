When creating a Kubernetes manifest for more complex scenarios such as a Pod that requires persistent storage, load balancing, and services, the proper approach is to write clear, modular, and declarative YAML manifest files


1. **Use Multiple Manifest Files or Group Resources Logically**  
    Instead of putting everything in one large file, split your manifests into related files or group them logically (e.g., one file for Pod/Deployment, one for PersistentVolumeClaim, one for Service, one for LoadBalancer) for clarity and ease of updates.

**Define Core Resources Explicitly**

- **Pod or Deployment**: Define the desired container(s), including image, ports, and volume mounts.
- **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)**: Declare your storage requirements that the Pod will use for persistent storage.
- **Service**: Define how to expose your pods interally for load balancing and use of service type `LoadBalancer`
- **Volumes**:  Attach PVCs to pods via volume mounts

1. **Separate Configuration From Code**  
    Use ConfigMaps or Secrets to provide environment-specific variables and sensitive data rather than hardcoding them in the manifest.
    
2. **Use Namespaces and Labels for Logical Separation**  
    Assign namespaces if you have multiple environments or tenant isolation, and use meaningful, semantic labels to identify and group resources.
