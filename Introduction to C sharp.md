# C# 

**Most Commonly Used Programming Language**: C# (Pronounced as C-Sharp) which is one of the most widely used Programming languages in the world. Its popular because of its versatility and broad range  of applications that it can be used for. like -> 

- Web development 
- Game Development 
- Enterprise Software 
- Advanced Software

**Development History:** C# was developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET framework and was first introduced in the year 2000.
- It was designed to be a simple, modern, and object-oriented language 
- that could serve as an alternative to languages like Java and C++.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: C# supports OOP in which that it is centered around objects and classes. 
- This was done to allow developers to model real world entities and relationships 

**Platform Independence:**  C# tied only to windows in the beginning of its life through .NET Framework. 
- However with the Introduction of .NET core and 5/6/7 C#  became platform-independent
- allowing developers to write code that runs Windows,Linux, and MacOS 
- And even Mobile platforms 

**High Level Programming language:**
As a high-level language, C# abstracts away much of the complexity associated with low-level programming tasks, such as memory management and direct hardware manipulation. This makes it easier for developers to focus on solving business problems rather than dealing with the intricacies of the underlying hardware.

**Procedure-Oriented Programming (POP):**
As a high level Language C# is primarily objected-oriented it also supports procedural programming, allowing devs to write code in a more structured and linear fashion 

**Type Safety:**  C# is a type-safe language, which means it enforces strict rules regarding how data types are used in code. Type safety meaning it prevents common programming errors such as accessing memory locations the program doesn't have access to. 

**Interoperability:** C# offers excellent Interoperability meaning that it interacts with other languages and systems including C++. This allows C# for programs to perform tasks that are typically handled by native C++ applications, providing devs with the best of both worlds. 

**Component-Oriented Programming:** C# supports component-oriented programming, a design paradigm that emphasizes the use of interchangeable software components.
-  This approach promotes code reuse and allows developers to build complex systems by assembling pre-built components.

**Structured Programming:** C# is also a structured programming language, which means it allows developers to break down programs into smaller, manageable parts using functions or methods
-  This makes the code more organized, readable, and easier to debug.

**Speed:** C# is designed to be a fast and efficient language. 
- While it might not match the raw performance of lower-level languages like C++, the *Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation* used by C# ensures that programs run with a high level of performance 
- making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including those that require significant computational power.
