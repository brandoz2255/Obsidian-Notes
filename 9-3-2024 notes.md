### **Literature Notes: GeoGebra Usage in Calc 2**

#### **1. Setting Up a Function and Graphing**

- **Input Functions**:
    - To input a function, simply type it into the input bar at the bottom of the screen. For example, typing `f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x + 1` will plot the cubic function on the graph.
    - GeoGebra automatically adjusts the graph view based on the function’s range.
- **Graph Adjustment**:
    - You can zoom in/out or pan the graph by using the scroll wheel or dragging the axes, making it easier to visualize different portions of your curve.

#### **2. Calculating Upper and Lower Sums (Riemann Sums)**

- **Upper and Lower Sum Commands**:
    - Use `UpperSum(f, a, b, n)` to calculate the upper Riemann sum of the function $f(x)$ between points $a$ and $b$, with $n$ intervals.
        - Example: `UpperSum(f, 0, 2, 100)` calculates the upper sum of $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x + 1$ from 0 to 2 with 100 intervals.
    - Similarly, use `LowerSum(f, a, b, n)` for lower sums.
- **Visualizing the Sums**:
    - GeoGebra automatically shows the rectangles used in the Riemann sum approximations, helping you see whether the sum is over- or underestimating the area under the curve.
- **Pro Tip**: You can adjust the number of intervals (n) to see how increasing n gets the sum closer to the exact area (the integral).

#### **3. Summation Notation in GeoGebra**

- **Summation Symbol**:
    - To input a summation, use the `Sum` function. The syntax is: `Sum(expression, variable, start, end)`
        - Example: `Sum(k^2, k, 1, n)` computes the sum of $k^2$ from 1 to $n$.
    - This is useful for representing sums like $\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2$ and analyzing them in terms of $n$.
- **Factorization and Simplification**:
    - GeoGebra has a `Factor` command which lets you factor sums or polynomials. You can apply this to simplify expressions.
        - Example: `Factor(1/3 * n^3 + 1/2 * n^2 + 1/6 * n)` simplifies a cubic summation formula into a factorized form.

#### **4. Calculating Definite Integrals**

- **Integral Command**:
    
    - To calculate a definite integral (area under the curve), use: `Integral(f, a, b)`
        - Example: `Integral(f, 0, 2)` will calculate the exact area under $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x + 1$ from 0 to 2.
- **Visualization**:
    
    - The area under the curve gets shaded on the graph, so you can visually check if the integral makes sense with respect to the graph.

#### **5. Limits and Series**

- **Limit Command**:
    - For calculating limits, use: `Limit(expression, variable, point)`
        - Example: `Limit((4 + 2/n), n, Infinity)` calculates the limit of the sequence $4+ \frac{2} as n→∞n \to \inftyn→∞$ 
- **Series and Summation**:
    - GeoGebra allows for summation series as well, particularly useful when analyzing convergence/divergence in calculus.
        - Example: Use `Sum(f(k), k, 1, n)` to sum a function across a range of values, as seen in series-based problems.

#### **6. Exporting and Sharing Work**

- **Exporting Results**:
    - GeoGebra allows you to export your graphs or results as images or PDFs, which is super helpful for turning in assignments or documenting steps.
- **Copying Work**:
    - You can easily copy and paste results (like sum or integral outputs) into a separate document, especially when you want to focus on the algebraic results.
