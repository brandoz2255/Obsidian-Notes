Docker buildx is an extension of the Docker CLI that provides advanced capabilities for building Docker images using BuildKit[1](https://depot.dev/blog/docker-buildx-explained)[3](https://docs.docker.com/build/concepts/overview/). It's a more powerful and flexible alternative to the traditional `docker build` command.

## Key Differences from Regular Docker Build

1. **BuildKit Integration**: Buildx uses BuildKit as its backend, which offers improved performance, caching, and concurrent processing compared to the legacy builder[1](https://depot.dev/blog/docker-buildx-explained)[3](https://docs.docker.com/build/concepts/overview/).
2. **Multi-Platform Support**: Buildx allows you to create images for multiple architectures and operating systems simultaneously, which is not possible with the standard `docker build`[5](https://earthly.dev/blog/docker-buildx/).
3. **Advanced Caching**: BuildKit, used by buildx, provides more intelligent layer caching, resulting in faster builds and smaller images[2](https://northflank.com/blog/docker-build-and-buildx-best-practices-for-optimized-builds).
4. **Flexible Build Environments**: Buildx operates on BuildKit builders, which are dedicated environments for building images. This allows for more configuration options and the ability to use different builders for different projects[1](https://depot.dev/blog/docker-buildx-explained).
5. **Enhanced Features**: Buildx supports additional functionalities like build secrets, SSH socket forwarding, and improved build argument handling[3](https://docs.docker.com/build/concepts/overview/).

## Why Buildx is Preferred

1. **Default in Modern Docker**: As of Docker version 23.0 (February 2023), buildx is the default build command. `docker build` is now an alias for `docker buildx build`[1](https://depot.dev/blog/docker-buildx-explained)[4](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78897082/difference-between-docker-buildx-build-and-docker-build-for-multi-arch-images).
    
2. **Improved Performance**: The advanced caching and concurrent processing capabilities of BuildKit often result in faster build times[2](https://northflank.com/blog/docker-build-and-buildx-best-practices-for-optimized-builds).
