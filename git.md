Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files, primarily used for managing source code in software development projects[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)[3](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-git-version-control/). It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has since become the `de facto` standard for version control, with nearly 95% of developers using it as their primary system as of 2022[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git).
