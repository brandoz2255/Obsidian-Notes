- Hi, I’m Brandon Sanchez, a Computer Science student with a focus on Cybersecurity, and a deep passion for both cybersecurity and AI. I’ve always been fascinated by how technology empowers us but also presents unique security challenges. 
- Over the years, I’ve developed a solid understanding of **network security**, **incident response**, and **penetration testing**. Through personal projects and competitions, I’ve gained hands-on experience using tools like **Splunk**, **Wireshark**, and the **MITRE ATT&CK framework**. 
- Additionally, I’ve had the opportunity to lead workshops on **Docker containerization**, where I demonstrated and taught its practical applications for various projects. I’m deeply excited about this internship because it offers the chance to apply my skills in real-world environments, which will help me grow as an aspiring cybersecurity professional. I’m eager to contribute to MITRE’s mission and help defend our nation’s cybersecurity landscape.



Hello Im Brandon Sanchez Im a Computer Student with a focus in Cybersecurity at CSUSB, with a deep passion in Cybersecurity and AI I've been envlovled in Cybesecurity since I was in Highshool, during highschool i competed in Cyberpatriot, NCL, and NCL Mayors cup. Where from there I applied to CSUSB and immediately joined the Cyber club there and from there I became the student outreach officer for that club and became a project leader and project co-lead for Docker, and Linux. How we do projects is we introduce a topic and teach it then we engage in a full project together to make something or do something together as a team.

### Why them 

I've been following MITRE for a while and I'm deeply impressed by their leadership in cybersecurity innovation. MITRE's commitment to creating and leveraging cutting-edge tools like Caldera, ATT&CK, and ATT&CK Navigator aligns perfectly with my career goals in incident response and threat hunting. 
MITRE's History of Innovation spans over six decades dating back to 1958 and its legacy of innovation still continues on to this day with their flagship Cybersecurity products. Such as Caldera the automated adversary emulation platform to simulate real-world attacks and the MITRE ATTACK framework and Navigator assisting in knowledge base framework for cyber threat analysis and a visualization tool that helps understand and communicate with adversary behavior.
