3. **Choosing Test Points**: You choose test points from each of the intervals created by the critical points. The test points should be numbers that are easy to plug into the derivative and are representative of their respective intervals. For instance:

- For $\( (-∞, -2) \)$, you could choose any number less than -2, such as -3.
- For $\( (-2, 2) \)$, you could choose 0 because it’s easy to work with and is between -2 and 2.
- For $\( (2, ∞) \)$, you could choose 3 because it’s just greater than 2.

4. **Checking Signs**: You substitute these test points into the first derivative. The sign of the derivative at these points tells you whether the function is increasing or decreasing on that interval.

5. **Determination of Intervals**: If the derivative is positive on an interval, the function is increasing there. If it’s negative, the function is decreasing.

It’s important to remember that critical points are where the derivative is zero or undefined, and they serve as potential locations for local maxima, minima, or points of inflection. The intervals determined by these critical points are where the actual behavior of the function is analyzed. 

On a test, drawing a number line and marking the critical points is a quick visual way to segment the domain of the function into intervals for analysis with the first derivative test.
