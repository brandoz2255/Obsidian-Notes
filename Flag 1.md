Create a Yaml file 

```yaml

```

### plan 

- starts in a virtual environment inside the Kali box of the cisoCTF site

Essentially the open the machine and they navigate to the terminal once opened the docker containers should running from the start where all they would need to is run `docker ps` and it lists three containers two are just dumb ones 

- where one of the containers names will be cisoCTF{ThisistheFlagforWhalinDocker1}


#### What ill need to do 

- Three docker files for the images 
- one docker compose for the starting these images 
- tell alberto or jaylyn how can the docker start once the machine starts 
	- if not possible plan b starting the container is part of the CTF then they would need to just docker ps
