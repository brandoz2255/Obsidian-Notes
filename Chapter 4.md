|**Goal**|Manage task control, handlers, and task errors in Ansible Playbooks.|
|**Objectives**|- Use loops to write efficient tasks and use conditions to control when to run tasks.<br>    <br>- Implement a task that runs only when another task changes the managed host.<br>    <br>- Control what happens when a task fails, and what conditions cause a task to fail.|
|**Sections**|- Writing Loops and Conditional Tasks (and Guided Exercise)<br>    <br>- Implementing Handlers (and Guided Exercise)<br>    <br>- Handling Task Failure (and Guided Exercise)|
