# albert edition 

- severs 
- clients 
- switches 
	- between networks 
- ap 
	- converts binary signals to  radio waves into 
	- 2.4ghz or 5 ghz 
- modems 
	- connect to ISP 
- OSI Model 
	- Unmanaged | Managed 
- VLAN
- Routers 
	- DIFFERENT
	- within network
- Copper RJ-45 | RJ-11 
- Optical uses light special light 1 and 0 s 
- UTP | STP
	- Unshielded twisted pair Sheiled twisted pair 
	- UTP commonly used 
	- STP has sheilfs tha can og over each pair 
- Grounding 
- Electricity and how it works 
- POE 
	- why is it special on the low level how is it seperate from cat 4 5 6 and 7 8 9 
- Single mode 
- multi-mode 
- TCP/IP model 
	- Important concept for Network engineering and anyform of network diagnostic any thign cyber basically 
- Father Network
	- Arpanet 
		- cabling 
	- introduced packet switching 
- OSI TCP/IP 
	- OSI is 7 layers TCP/IP is 5
	- All people seem to need data protection 
	- from 1 to 4 it has a different name 
	- PDU protocol data unit the name for information at specific layer of the OSI model 
- PDU 
	- Physical PDU 
	- Data link PDU 
	- Network PDU 
	- Transport PDU 
- Encoding method 
- AMI 
- bits 
- bit synchronization 
- Encapsulation 
- Network Layer 
- Networkin as a whole is based off of the usa postal system 
- Network layer takes frames with physical addressing and logical addressing 
- done with packet switching 
- Packet switching 
- Transport Layer 
	- One is TCP and other is UDP 
	- Transmission control protocol 
	- User Datagram Protocol 
- 3 way handshake 
- Checksum '
- Windowing 
- Buffering
	- Taildrop 
- Application Layer 
- Response or requests 
- How data is presented or encrypted session between devices maintained 


- Subnet mask is a number of bits that can dictate how many ip addresses are on a network 

- Public ip addresses needs to be unique but also needs to differentiate it self from the private ip addresses hence the reasoning for classes in public ips 

- CIDR notation 
- 

[[noting]]


## Subnetting 


- ill come back to this 
- 256 number of 
- /32 is the lowest /1 would be biggest number of network bits 
- number of network bits is the inversed number of network hosts
