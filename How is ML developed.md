## How ML is Developed (in DevOps Terms)

**1. Data Engineering & Preparation**

- Raw data is collected, cleaned, validated, and transformed to ensure quality and relevance for model training.
- This step is analogous to preparing build artifacts in DevOps, but here the "artifact" is structured data[1](https://www.aegissofttech.com/insights/devops-for-machine-learning/)[2](https://jozu.com/blog/understanding-the-mlops-lifecycle/).

**2. Model Development & Training**

- Data scientists and ML engineers design, code, and train models using the prepared data.
- Experiment tracking tools (like `MLflow`, Weights & Biases) are used to log model versions, parameters, and results, similar to source control and CI logs in DevOps[1](https://www.aegissofttech.com/insights/devops-for-machine-learning/)[2](https://www.phdata.io/blog/mlops-vs-devops-whats-the-difference/).\

**3. Model Evaluation**

- Models are validated against test datasets to ensure they meet performance criteria.
- This is similar to automated testing in CI pipelines[1](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/how-to-accelerate-devops-with-machine-learning-lifecycle-management/)[2](https://www.phdata.io/blog/mlops-vs-devops-whats-the-difference/).

**4. Deployment (CI/CD for ML)**

- Once validated, models are packaged (often in containers) and deployed to production environments using CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, `Kubernetes`).
- Automated pipelines ensure repeatable, reliable deployments and rollbacks—just like with application code[1](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/how-to-accelerate-devops-with-machine-learning-lifecycle-management/)[2](https://www.aegissofttech.com/insights/devops-for-machine-learning/)[3](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning).

**5. Monitoring & Retraining**

- In production, models are monitored for performance and data drift (when real-world data changes).
- Retraining is triggered as needed, forming a continuous loop—this is akin to application monitoring and hotfix cycles in DevOps[1](https://jozu.com/blog/understanding-the-mlops-lifecycle/)[2](https://www.phdata.io/blog/mlops-vs-devops-whats-the-difference/).

**6. Collaboration & Versioning****6. Collaboration & Versioning**

- Retraining is triggered as needed, forming a continuous loop—this is akin to application monitoring and hotfix cycles in DevOps[1](https://jozu.com/blog/understanding-the-mlops-lifecycle/)[2](https://www.phdata.io/blog/mlops-vs-devops-whats-the-difference/).
