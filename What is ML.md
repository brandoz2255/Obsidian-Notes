Machine  Learning: is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to automatically learn from data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions with minimal human intervention[1](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/machine-learning/)[2](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/articles/what-is-ml/)[3](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-machine-learning)[4](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/machine-learning)[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning). For a technical person, ML can be described as follows:

ML Algorithms: 

- are trained on historical datasets to extract statistical patterns and relationships, which they then use to make predictions or classify new, unseen data[1](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/machine-learning/)[4](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-machine-learning)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/ml-machine-learning/)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).

- Unlike traditional programming (where explicit rules are coded), ML systems improve their performance on specific tasks as they are exposed to more data, optimizing their internal parameters through iterative processes such as gradient descent and loss minimization[1](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-machine-learning)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).

- ML encompasses a variety of techniques, including supervised learning (training on labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding structure in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error with feedback)[1](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-machine-learning)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)[3](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-machine-learning).

- Common Apps: include image and speech recognition, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and predictive analytics[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/ml-machine-learning/)[2](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-machine-learning).

A widely cited formal definition (by Tom M. Mitchell) is:

> "A computer program is said to learn from experience _E_ with respect to some class of tasks _T_ and performance measure _P_ if its performance at tasks in _T_, as measured by _P_, improves with experience _E_
