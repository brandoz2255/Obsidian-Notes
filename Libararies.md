Here are key Python libraries for parsing Snort alerts and triggering automated responses, based on real-world implementations from the search results:

## Core Alert Parsing Libraries

1. **`unified2`**
    
    - Parses Snort's binary `unified2` logs into Python objects
    - Example workflow:

```python
import unified2.parser
for event, _ in unified2.parser.parse('/var/log/snort/snort.u2'):
    print(f"Alert ID: {event['event_id']}, Src IP: {event['src_ip']}")
```

Used in projects like [mk-fg/unified2](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/give-me-10-things-that-a-soc-o-uJFkdb9DSuu2uG8kOtkSCg#) for direct log processing[1](https://github.com/mk-fg/unified2).

**`pyparsing`**

- Handles text-based Snort alert logs with complex formats
- Creates grammar rules for multi-line alerts:

```python
from pyparsing import Suppress, Combine, Regex
header = Suppress("[**]") + Combine(...)  # Alert header parsing
```


## Alert Triggering & Automation
- This one we are most likely going to need
3. **`subprocess`/`pexpect`**
    
    - Executes scripts on Snort alerts in real-time:
    - [[subprocess library]]

```python
import subprocess
subprocess.run(['/path/to/response_script.py', alert_data])
```

Used for GPIO triggers on Raspberry Pi security systems[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28753762/execute-script-on-snort-alert).


**`smtplib`/`twilio`**

- Sends email/SMS notifications: we can do it differently
