To properly download and run a Helm chart for your Kubernetes needs, you should follow a series of best practices centered around installing Helm correctly, using trusted chart repositories, customizing charts for your environment, and maintaining good lifecycle and security management. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

- Download and install the Helm CLI on your local machine or management workstation. You can use the official install script or grab binaries for your OS.
- Ensure your `kubectl` is configured to access your Kubernetes cluster, as Helm requires cluster-admin permissions to fully manage resources.
- Validate installation by running `helm version` after setup.
